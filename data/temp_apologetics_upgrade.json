Scholar Paul Williams notes that while the karma system appears fair, it is actually a cycle of despair — no one can completely eliminate all bad karma. Even within Buddhism, it's acknowledged that even those achieving arhatship still require extensive practice to fully escape karma's bondage. The Christian Gospel offers something radically different: salvation is God's grace — not what you have done, but what God has done for you in Christ. As Ephesians 2:8-9 states: 'For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.'

Buddhist scholar David Loy notes in his writings that the karma system is actually hopeless — no one can completely eliminate all bad karma, and every imperfect action, thought, or motivation generates new karmic consequences. Even the most devout Buddhists acknowledge needing countless rebirths to possibly reach nirvana. Christian grace seems 'unfair,' but this is precisely its beauty — Christ bore justice's full judgment on the Cross. The price was indeed fully paid, just not by us. This doesn't cancel justice but represents God Himself satisfying justice's demands. As John Stott said, the Cross is where 'love conquered justice without canceling it.' This is the perfect intersection of deepest justice and deepest love, offering genuine peace that the karma system can never provide."

Someone rescued from drowning doesn't want to jump back in; similarly, those saved by grace don't want to continue in sin. Grace not only forgives sin but gives new life and a heart that desires holiness (Ezekiel 36:26-27). Reformed theologians clearly emphasize: salvation is by faith alone (sola fide), but true faith necessarily produces the fruit of good works.

Buddhist scholar Richard Hayes found that karma doctrine often leads to fatalism — since all suffering results from past karma, people easily become passive toward social injustice. In traditional Buddhist societies, caste systems and social inequality were often rationalized through karma theory. Conversely, Christian grace releases tremendous moral energy. William Wilberforce's abolition efforts, Martin Luther King's civil rights movement, Mother Teresa's service to the poor — these all stemmed from grace's motivation, not merit calculations. Grace teaches believers: since God loves you unconditionally, you must love others unconditionally; since Christ gave himself for you, you must give yourself for others. This motivation of love far exceeds karma's fear-based motivation, producing more enduring and purer moral action. As Calvin said, justified believers become 'Christ's hands and feet,' actively participating in God's work of renewing the world."

The 'hard problem of consciousness' — why subjective experience exists — has no purely materialistic explanation. Prominent philosopher David Chalmers notes that even if we completely map the brain's neural connections, we still cannot explain why there is an inner experience of 'what it is like.' Moreover, rational thought, free will, and moral responsibility all presuppose a unified, enduring subject. If the self is merely an illusion of neural activity, who observes this illusion? Who concludes that 'the self is an illusion'? This falls into self-referential contradiction. The Christian view of the soul provides a coherent explanation: humans possess both material body and immaterial soul, together constituting complete personhood."

Buddhism aims for complete extinction of 'self,' but whose liberation is this? If there's no subject, there's no one to enjoy peace. Christianity offers a better vision: the self finds true fulfillment in love. When we love God and others, we don't lose ourselves but discover our true selves. Love is self-giving, not self-denial. In the eternal love of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Spirit each maintain personal distinctiveness while being perfectly united in love.

If 'no one attains nirvana,' practice becomes meaningless. Buddhists themselves debate this fiercely — Theravada Buddhism maintains strict no-self doctrine, Mahayana Yogācāra introduced 'ālaya-vijñāna' to maintain continuity, and Tantric Buddhism even developed 'Buddha-nature' concepts. These theoretical developments actually show that complete no-self doctrine is impractical.

This diagnosis is profound but incomplete. Christianity acknowledges suffering's reality but offers a different diagnosis and prescription: suffering's root is not desire itself but humanity's rebellion against God (sin), causing all creation to deviate from God's original design. Renowned theologian Paul Tillich identified humanity's basic problem as 'alienation' — broken relationships with God, others, self, and nature. The solution is not eliminating all desires and withdrawing into desireless states, but restoring and renewing relationships. God doesn't ask us to escape the world but enters the world's suffering Himself — in Jesus Christ's Cross and Resurrection, God bore suffering's ultimate weight and conquered it. Christian hope is not escaping this world into void-like peace but God renewing all things, eliminating all suffering, tears, and death in the new heavens and earth (Revelation 21:4).

But there's a fundamental difference: reducing subjective feelings of pain differs from addressing suffering's root causes. Psychological research shows mindfulness meditation can alleviate depression and anxiety symptoms, but it cannot address objective realities causing suffering — injustice, oppression, death. If genuine injustice exists in the world (genocide, human trafficking, child abuse), the right response is not meditating away one's 'attachment' to these evils but actively combating injustice. Mother Teresa serving in Calcutta's slums, Martin Luther King fighting for civil rights, William Wilberforce abolishing slavery — these didn't involve meditating to escape suffering but directly confronting and fighting it. Christianity calls believers both to trust God amid suffering for inner peace and to actively alleviate others' suffering — because every person is made in God's image with inherent dignity and worth."

God could instantly eliminate all suffering, but that would mean simultaneously destroying all sinners — including every one of us, as we all participate in sinful structures causing suffering. God chose a harder but more loving path: bearing suffering's cost Himself on the Cross, giving humanity time to repent, and promising complete renewal when Christ returns. Theologian John Stott noted the Cross represents 'theology of God's suffering' — God doesn't remain distant from suffering but enters it. Buddhist nirvana is essentially individual escape from the suffering cycle, a state of 'nothingness'; Christian hope is the renewal and restoration of all creation — not escape from the world but the world's redemption. Revelation 21:1-4's new heavens and earth is not void but renewed reality where 'God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.'"

        "response_en": "This comparison misunderstands both traditions' cores. Buddhist compassion (karuṇā), while precious, faces theoretical difficulties within the strict no-self framework: if there's no real self, who experiences suffering? Who is compassion's object? Why care about non-existent beings? Buddhist scholar Paul Williams noted this contradiction as a key reason for his conversion from Buddhism to Christianity. Christian love (agape) is deeper because it's built on solid personal ontological foundations: every person is a real being made in God's image, worthy of love. Regarding judgment, Christian judgment precisely expresses love — love must say 'no' to injustice and evil. Renowned theologian Miroslav Volf argues in 'Exclusion and Embrace' that without final judgment there's no true forgiveness. God's judgment ensures evil doesn't ultimately triumph and victims' voices are heard. More importantly, Christianity proclaims God Himself bore the judgment — on the Cross, God is both judge and judged, maintaining justice while providing redemption. This love far exceeds theoretical compassion because it paid the ultimate price."

        "response_zh": "主观感受不能作为真理的可靠检验。许多不同宗教的信徒都报告了类似的强烈宗教体验——伊斯兰神秘主义者、印度教瑜伽士、甚至异教徒都有强烈的"属灵"体验。耶利米书17:9说"人心比万物都诡诈，坏到极处，谁能识透呢？"我们不能信赖自己的感受作为真理的最终仲裁。真理必须以客观标准来检验——上帝的话语（圣经）。此外，《摩尔门经》的历史性主张（如古代美洲的大规模文明、战争、马匹、钢铁、轮子等）完全没有考古证据支持。史密斯安研究所（Smithsonian Institution）和美国国家地理学会都公开声明《摩尔门经》没有考古价值。相比之下，圣经考古学提供了大量确认圣经记录的证据。著名考古学家威廉·奥尔布莱特（William Albright）称圣经为"有史以来考古发现支持最多的古代文献"。感受可能欺骗我们，但客观证据不会。",
        "response_en": "Subjective feelings are not a reliable test for truth. Adherents of many different religions report similar intense spiritual experiences — Islamic mystics, Hindu yogis, even pagans have powerful 'spiritual' experiences. Jeremiah 17:9 says 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?' We cannot trust our feelings as truth's final arbiter. Truth must be tested by objective standards — God's Word (the Bible). Moreover, the Book of Mormon's historical claims (large ancient American civilizations, battles, horses, steel, wheels, etc.) have zero archaeological support. The Smithsonian Institution and National Geographic Society have publicly stated the Book of Mormon has no archaeological value. By contrast, biblical archaeology provides abundant evidence confirming biblical records. Renowned archaeologist William Albright called the Bible 'the most archaeologically supported ancient document in history.' Feelings may deceive us, but objective evidence doesn't."

        "objection_zh": "约瑟·史密斯的遭遇和保罗在大马士革路上的经历很相似。",
        "objection_en": "Joseph Smith's experience resembles Paul's on the Damascus Road.",
        "response_zh": "表面相似不等于实质相同。保罗的经历有多重验证：（1）有目击证人（使徒行传9:7）；（2）立即的生命改变——从迫害教会转为传播福音；（3）最重要的是，保罗的信息与已有的使徒见证完全一致，他没有添加新的救恩方式或新的神学体系。保罗在加拉太书1:11-12声称他的福音是直接从基督领受的，但在加拉太书1:18-19他去耶路撒冷与其他使徒确认，确保信息的一致性。相比之下，史密斯的"启示"建立了一个全新的神学体系，与圣经根本冲突。史密斯声称"没有任何教派是正确的"，这直接否定了两千年的基督教历史。史密斯的多次"第一次异象"叙述版本不一致（1832年只提到耶稣，1838年版本才有圣父圣子同时显现），而保罗的见证从未改变。历史学家方洪·布罗迪（Fawn Brodie）在《没有人知道我的历史》中详细记录了史密斯叙述的矛盾之处。",
        "response_en": "Surface similarity doesn't equal substantive equivalence. Paul's experience has multiple verifications: (1) Witnesses present (Acts 9:7); (2) Immediate life transformation — from persecuting the church to spreading the Gospel; (3) Most importantly, Paul's message was completely consistent with existing apostolic witness; he added no new salvation methods or theological systems. Paul claimed in Galatians 1:11-12 that his gospel came directly from Christ, but in Galatians 1:18-19 he went to Jerusalem to confirm with other apostles, ensuring message consistency. By contrast, Smith's 'revelations' established an entirely new theological system fundamentally conflicting with Scripture. Smith claimed 'no denomination was correct,' directly negating two millennia of Christian history. Smith's multiple 'First Vision' account versions are inconsistent (1832 mentions only Jesus; 1838 version has both Father and Son appearing), while Paul's testimony never changed. Historian Fawn Brodie in 'No Man Knows My History' documented Smith's narrative contradictions in detail."
