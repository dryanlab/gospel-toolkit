    "detailed_answer_en": "This question assumes that only visible things are real, but that assumption is itself problematic. The most important realities in our lives — laws of logic, moral standards, mathematical truths, love — are all invisible, yet we never question their reality.\n\nThe Bible tells us that God's eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived through what has been made (Romans 1:20). The fine-tuning of the universe, humanity's innate moral intuitions, and revelation in history all point to a transcendent Creator.\n\nMore importantly, the Christian God is not an abstract concept but a person who acts in history.

The fact that we intuitively know suffering 'shouldn't be' implies a standard of how things 'should be' — and that standard points to God.\n\nThe Bible never avoids the problem of suffering, but offers a unique response: God is not watching our pain from afar.

Christians need not feel they must accept this hypothesis just because 'most scientists accept it.'\n\nMore importantly, even within the evolutionary hypothesis framework, it cannot answer fundamental questions: Why does life exist? Why do natural laws exist? Why are the universe's parameters precisely tuned to permit life? These questions point to a purposeful Creator.

God preserves them to the end.\n\nThese five points aren't independent doctrines but one coherent salvation narrative: because people are totally depraved, God must initiate election; because God elects, Christ dies effectively for them; because Christ's death is effective, the Spirit inevitably draws them; because it's God's work, they are surely preserved.",

Because God cannot lie (Titus 1:2), His Word is entirely trustworthy and sufficient. The Westminster Confession teaches that Scripture is 'the only rule of faith and practice.'\n\nThis also means Scripture needs no external validation to possess authority. Just as light needs no proof of its existence, Scripture carries inherent authority because it is God's Word. The Holy Spirit testifies in believers' hearts, confirming Scripture's divine origin.

In reality, these books were recognized as God's Word from the moment they were written.

Later councils (like Carthage in AD 397) merely formally confirmed what the church had already recognized in practice.

According to His human nature, Jesus grew and learned like all humans (Luke 2:52). According to His divine nature, He remained the omniscient God.\n\nReformed theology emphasizes the doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum (communication of attributes): because two natures are united in one person, attributes of one nature can be predicated of the whole person.

This is the most staggering event in cosmic history — the eternal, infinite God entered finite human existence.

First, the wages of sin is death (Rom 6:23), and the death of angels or animals cannot substitute for humans. Only a human death can atone for human sin. But ordinary humans are themselves sinners, unable to atone for others. Therefore a sinless, perfect human was needed — and only God becoming human could achieve this.\n\nSecond, the incarnation enables God to truly identify with our suffering. Hebrews 4:15 says our High Priest 'is not unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but was tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin.' God didn't command us to suffer from a distance but personally experienced every human suffering. This assures us in our trials: God understands.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "许多人把圣灵想象成一种模糊的属灵能量，但圣经清楚地教导圣灵是一个位格。祂有位格的三个特征：理智（林前2:10-11，祂参透万事）、情感（弗4:30，祂会忧伤）、意志（林前12:11，祂随己意分配恩赐）。祂用言语说话（徒13:2），祂引导（罗8:14），祂代求（罗8:26）。这些都不是一种力量能做的。\n\n圣灵不仅是一个位格，而且是完全的上帝。使徒行传5:3-4中，彼得说欺哄圣灵就是欺哄上帝。圣灵参与了创造（创1:2），参与了基督的道成肉身（路1:35），参与了基督的复活（罗8:11）。三位一体的每一项大工，圣灵都有参与。\n\n对基督徒而言，圣灵是使我们重生的那一位（约3:5-8），是住在我们里面的那一位（林前6:19），是使我们成圣、赐给我们恩赐、引导我们明白真理的那一位。没有圣灵的工作，没有人能认识基督、相信福音。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Many imagine the Holy Spirit as a vague spiritual energy, but Scripture clearly teaches He is a person. He possesses the three marks of personhood: intellect (1 Cor 2:10-11, He searches all things), emotion (Eph 4:30, He can be grieved), and will (1 Cor 12:11, He distributes gifts as He wills). He speaks (Acts 13:2), guides (Rom 8:14), and intercedes (Rom 8:26). No mere force can do these things.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is not only a person but fully God. In Acts 5:3-4, Peter says lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God. The Spirit participated in creation (Gen 1:2), Christ's incarnation (Luke 1:35), and Christ's resurrection (Rom 8:11). Every great work of the Trinity involves the Spirit.\n\nFor Christians, the Holy Spirit is the one who regenerates us (John 3:5-8), dwells within us (1 Cor 6:19), sanctifies us, gives us gifts, and guides us into truth.

    "detailed_answer_zh": "圣灵在基督徒生命中的工作可以从几个方面理解：\n\n首先是重生和归信。人靠自己无法相信福音（林前2:14），是圣灵使死在罪中的人活过来（弗2:1-5），赐给他们新心（结36:26-27），使他们能够悔改和相信。\n\n其次是成圣。重生是一次性的，但成圣是一生的过程。圣灵在信徒里面持续工作，使他们越来越像基督（林后3:18），结出圣灵的果子——仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、信实、温柔、节制（加5:22-23）。\n\n第三是恩赐和事奉。圣灵按照自己的旨意赐给每位信徒不同的属灵恩赐（林前12:4-11），目的是建造基督的身体——教会。没有任何恩赐是不重要的，也没有任何信徒是没有恩赐的。\n\n最后，圣灵是我们得基业的凭据（弗1:13-14），就像定金一样，保证上帝会完成祂在我们身上开始的善工。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "The Holy Spirit's work in a Christian's life can be understood in several aspects:\n\nFirst, regeneration and conversion. People cannot believe the gospel on their own (1 Cor 2:14); it is the Spirit who makes those dead in sin alive (Eph 2:1-5), gives them a new heart (Ezek 36:26-27), and enables repentance and faith.\n\nSecond, sanctification. Regeneration is a one-time event, but sanctification is a lifelong process. The Spirit works continually within believers, making them increasingly Christlike (2 Cor 3:18), producing the fruit of the Spirit — love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Gal 5:22-23).\n\nThird, gifts and ministry. The Spirit gives each believer different spiritual gifts according to His will (1 Cor 12:4-11), for building up Christ's body — the church. No gift is unimportant, and no believer is without gifts.\n\nFinally, the Spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance (Eph 1:13-14), like a down payment, assuring us that God will complete the good work He began in us.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "改革宗神学在这个问题上的立场可以用一句话概括：我们唯独因信称义，但那使我们称义的信心从来不是孤单的。\n\n保罗在罗马书和加拉太书中反复强调，没有人能靠遵行律法在上帝面前称义（罗3:20，加2:16）。称义是法庭用语——上帝宣告罪人为义，不是因为他们自己的义，而是因为基督的义被归算给他们。这完全是恩典的工作，通过信心领受。\n\n但雅各书2:26说「身体没有灵魂是死的，信心没有行为也是死的。」这与保罗矛盾吗？不。保罗讨论的是称义的根据（唯独信心），雅各讨论的是信心的证据（必然有行为）。一棵苹果树不是因为结了苹果才成为苹果树，但如果一棵树从不结苹果，你就有理由怀疑它是否真是苹果树。同样，好行为不使我们得救，但没有好行为的「信仰」让人怀疑它是否是真正的信心。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "The Reformed position on this issue can be summarized in one sentence: we are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone.\n\nPaul repeatedly emphasizes in Romans and Galatians that no one can be justified by works of the law (Rom 3:20, Gal 2:16). Justification is a legal term — God declares sinners righteous, not based on their own righteousness but because Christ's righteousness is imputed to them. This is entirely a work of grace, received through faith.\n\nBut James 2:26 says 'faith apart from works is dead.' Does this contradict Paul? No. Paul discusses the basis of justification (faith alone); James discusses the evidence of faith (works inevitably follow). An apple tree doesn't become an apple tree by producing apples, but if a tree never bears apples, you rightly question whether it's truly an apple tree. Similarly, good works don't save us, but 'faith' without good works raises the question of whether it's genuine faith at all.",

We're not accepted by God because we've improved but because Christ's righteousness is credited to our account.\n\nThis doctrine is crucial because it answers humanity's most fundamental question: how can sinful people stand before a holy God? If the answer is 'by your own effort,' no one can have assurance — you never know if you've done 'enough.' But if the answer is 'by what Christ has done for you,' assurance rests on Christ's finished work — and that never changes.\n\nThis was also the core discovery of the Reformation. Martin Luther, studying Romans 1:17, had his breakthrough: 'The righteous shall live by faith' — God's righteousness is not a standard of judgment to condemn us but a gift freely given to us.

This isn't merely a change in legal status but a change in the nature of our lives. A person regenerated by the Spirit has a new heart, new desires, new direction. They no longer delight in sin but grieve over it.\n\nOf course, Christians still sin — sanctification is a process, not instantaneous. But the direction changes: before, they sinned willingly; now, they sin with struggle. Before, sin brought no grief; now, it brings deep repentance.

Just as a president's treaty binds the entire nation, Adam's choice affected all his descendants.\n\nOriginal sin has two dimensions: imputed guilt (Adam's sin is charged to us) and inherited corruption (we're born with a disposition toward sin). This is why we don't need to teach children to lie or be selfish — it comes naturally. David said: 'I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me' (Psalm 51:5).\n\nThis may seem unfair, but it's actually the foundation of the gospel. Because sin was transmitted through a representative, salvation can also be received through a representative. Adam was the first representative, bringing sin and death; Christ is the second Adam, the last Adam (1 Cor 15:45), bringing righteousness and life.

    "detailed_answer_zh": "这是神学中最令人揪心的问题之一，我们需要以谦卑和敬畏来回应。\n\n关于婴儿：圣经确实教导原罪影响所有人（诗51:5, 罗5:12）。但许多改革宗神学家（包括加尔文本人）相信，上帝的拣选恩典可以在没有个人信心表达的情况下运作。威斯敏斯特信条（10.3）说：「被选的婴儿在幼年夭折的，由基督通过圣灵重生得救，圣灵何时何处以何种方式运作，都随祂的美意。」\n\n关于未闻福音的人：罗马书1:20教导所有人通过创造都有关于上帝的知识，因此没有人是完全无知的。罗马书2:14-15说上帝的律法写在人心里。同时，我们相信上帝的审判是完全公义的——亚伯拉罕的话永远成立：「审判全地的主岂不行公义吗？」（创18:25）。\n\n这些问题最终提醒我们两件事：我们不是审判者（上帝是），以及传福音的紧迫性——正因为我们不确定上帝会如何对待未闻福音的人，我们更应该竭力将福音传到地极。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "This is among theology's most heart-wrenching questions, requiring humility and reverence.\n\nRegarding infants: Scripture does teach original sin affects all (Psalm 51:5, Rom 5:12). But many Reformed theologians (including Calvin himself) believe God's electing grace can operate without a personal expression of faith. The Westminster Confession (10.3) states: 'Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who works when and where and how He pleases.'\n\nRegarding the unreached: Romans 1:20 teaches all people have knowledge of God through creation, so no one is entirely ignorant. Romans 2:14-15 says God's law is written on human hearts. We trust God's judgment is perfectly just — Abraham's words always stand: 'Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?' (Gen 18:25).\n\nThese questions ultimately remind us of two things: we are not the judge (God is), and the urgency of evangelism — precisely because we're uncertain how God deals with the unreached, we should strive all the more to bring the gospel to the ends of the earth.",

This is humanity's ultimate created purpose — what theologians call the 'beatific vision.' In this life we know God dimly, but there we'll know Him fully and directly. This alone is enough to produce eternal joy and satisfaction.\n\nSecond, we'll have glorified resurrection bodies (1 Cor 15:42-44), living in a renewed physical world. The mandate God gave humanity in Genesis — to steward creation (Gen 1:28) — will be fulfilled perfectly. This means work, creativity, exploration, learning — all without sin, fatigue, or frustration.\n\nThird, we'll enjoy perfect fellowship with all believers. No more misunderstanding, hurt, or loneliness. 'Then I shall know fully' (1 Cor 13:12). Heaven is not the end of everything but the true beginning of everything good. C.S.

    "detailed_answer_zh": "耶稣本人关于地狱的教导比圣经中任何其他人都多。祂在马太福音25:46说：「这些人要往永刑里去；那些义人要往永生里去。」这里「永」用的是同一个希腊词（aionios）——如果地狱不是永恒的，那天堂也不是。\n\n普救论——认为上帝最终会拯救所有人——虽然在情感上有吸引力，但面临几个严重的圣经和神学问题。首先，它直接与耶稣的教导矛盾（太7:13-14, 25:41-46）。其次，它实际上否定了人类选择的真实意义——如果最终所有人都会得救，那么今生的选择就不重要了。第三，它低估了罪对圣洁上帝的冒犯程度。\n\n地狱的永恒性反映了一个事实：罪不仅仅是违反规则，而是对无限圣洁的上帝的冒犯。冒犯的严重程度取决于被冒犯者的尊严——而上帝是无限尊贵的。这并不意味着我们应该以地狱来恐吓人，而是说我们应该严肃地对待罪，并且满怀感恩地宣传那使人脱离地狱的福音。",

In Matthew 25:46 He says: 'These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.' The same Greek word (aionios) is used for both — if hell isn't eternal, neither is heaven.\n\nUniversalism — the belief that God will eventually save everyone — is emotionally appealing but faces serious biblical and theological problems. First, it directly contradicts Jesus's teaching (Matt 7:13-14, 25:41-46). Second, it effectively negates the real significance of human choice — if everyone will eventually be saved, choices in this life don't truly matter. Third, it underestimates the gravity of sin's offense against a holy God.\n\nHell's eternality reflects the fact that sin is not merely breaking rules but offending an infinitely holy God. The severity of an offense depends on the dignity of the one offended — and God's dignity is infinite. This doesn't mean we should use hell to terrorize people, but that we should take sin seriously and proclaim with gratitude the gospel that delivers from hell.",

In Luke 23:43, Jesus tells the thief on the cross: 'Today you will be with me in paradise.' These passages clearly show that after death, a Christian's soul immediately enters God's presence.\n\nBut this 'intermediate state' is not the final destination. Christianity's ultimate hope isn't 'souls going to heaven' but bodily resurrection. 1 Corinthians 15 details the resurrection body — imperishable, powerful, glorious. On the day Christ returns, all who died in Christ will be raised with glorified new bodies.\n\nThis differs from Eastern religions' reincarnation and Greek philosophy's body-soul dualism. Christianity teaches the body is not the soul's prison but part of God's good creation, to be renewed and glorified. Our hope isn't escaping the material world but the material world itself being renewed — this is the promise of the new heaven and new earth.",

Death isn't the end but a doorway into eternity. For those who trust Christ, the soul immediately enters paradise with the Lord (Luke 23:43); for those who reject the gospel, the soul awaits final judgment.\n\nReincarnation also fails logically: if evildoers are reborn as animals, we'd expect ever-growing animal populations and shrinking human ones — the opposite of reality.

And this change isn't white-knuckle willpower — God gives new life that transforms desires from the inside, like someone who has tasted real cuisine and naturally loses interest in junk food.\n\nJesus said: 'I came that they may have life and have it abundantly' (John 10:10).",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "首先要明白：基督徒受苦并非上帝无能，而是上帝所许可的。耶稣说连一只麻雀掉在地上都需要天父许可，何况祂的儿女（太10:29-31）。\n\n上帝有时确实超自然地拯救祂的儿女脱离逼迫——使徒行传记载彼得在狱中被天使救出。但更多时候，上帝选择在苦难中同在，而非从苦难中挪去。\n\n为什么？因为血肉之躯的软弱人，若没有上帝的力量，根本不可能在酷刑和逼迫中仍然喜乐、平安、坚定。每一个在患难中依然信靠基督的见证，都是上帝同在的铁证。历史上，无数人正是看到殉道者脸上的平安和喜乐，才被深深触动而归信基督。\n\n此外，圣经应许苦难中的信心将来会得到「极重无比永远的荣耀」（林后4:17）。今生短暂的苦楚，换来的是永恒的赏赐。这就是为什么教会越受逼迫越兴旺——因为全能的上帝确实与他们同在。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "First, understand: Christians suffering isn't evidence of God's inability but of His permission. Jesus said even a sparrow doesn't fall without the Father's will, how much more His children (Matt 10:29-31).\n\nGod sometimes does supernaturally rescue His people — Acts records Peter freed from prison by an angel. But more often, God chooses to be present in suffering rather than remove it.\n\nWhy? Because if weak, flesh-and-blood humans can still experience joy, peace, and steadfastness under torture and persecution, this is ironclad proof of God's presence. Throughout history, countless people were deeply moved to faith by seeing the peace and joy on martyrs' faces.\n\nFurthermore, Scripture promises that faith amid suffering will receive 'an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison' (2 Cor 4:17). Brief suffering in this life yields eternal reward. This is why the church grows stronger under persecution — the Almighty God truly is with them.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "很多人以为不杀人、不犯法就不是罪人。但上帝对「罪」的定义远比法律严格。\n\n首先，「罪」的希腊原文是hamartia，意思是「偏离目标」。被造的人不认识、不敬拜造他的主，就已经是罪了——就像儿子不认亲生父亲一样忘恩负义。\n\n其次，上帝不只看行为，更看内心。耶稣说：「凡看见妇女就动淫念的，这人心里已经与她犯奸淫了。」（太5:28）按这个标准，谁敢说自己无罪？试想，如果把你上一周内心的每个念头——骄傲、嫉妒、恶毒、贪心、情欲——都拍成电影给所有人看，你承受得了吗？\n\n再者，违背上帝的律法就是罪。律法说「不可起贪心」（罗7:7），你只要有过贪念就犯了罪。而且犯一条就等于犯了众条（雅2:10），因为律法是一个整体。\n\n圣经的结论是：「没有义人，连一个也没有」（罗3:10），「世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀」（罗3:23）。这不是要定罪你，而是要你认识自己真实的处境，好来接受基督的拯救。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Many think not killing or breaking laws means they're not sinners. But God's definition of 'sin' is far stricter than any legal code.\n\nFirst, the Greek word for sin is hamartia, meaning 'missing the mark.' When created beings don't know or worship their Creator, that's already sin — like a child disowning their birth parent.\n\nSecond, God examines hearts, not just actions. Jesus said: 'Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart' (Matt 5:28). By this standard, who dares claim innocence? Imagine every thought from the past week — pride, jealousy, malice, greed, lust — displayed as a movie for everyone to see. Could you bear it?\n\nThird, breaking God's law is sin. The law says 'You shall not covet' (Rom 7:7) — one covetous thought makes you guilty. And breaking one commandment breaks them all (James 2:10), because the law is a unity.\n\nScripture concludes: 'None is righteous, no, not one' (Rom 3:10), 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God' (Rom 3:23).

Turning to the Creator isn't betraying ancestors; it's responding to their deepest unspoken plea.\n\nFurthermore, Buddhism itself isn't originally Chinese — it came from India. Confucianism isn't a complete religion either. Strictly speaking, Chinese people don't have a truly indigenous religion. And the God who created heaven and earth isn't limited by nationality — He's the Creator of all humanity.\n\nThe Bible explicitly teaches honoring parents (Eph 6:2), but true honor means caring for them with love while they're alive, not worshiping them after death (which actually invites evil spirits).

    "detailed_answer_zh": "这是一个很多人关心的问题。圣经的回答是清楚的：真正重生得救的人，拥有的是永远的救恩。理由如下：\n\n1.【救恩的可靠性】希伯来书5:9说基督「成了永远得救的根源」；10:14说「祂一次献祭，便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全。」注意——是祂的功劳使救恩完全，不是我们的表现。\n\n2.【基督和天父的保守】耶稣说：「谁也不能从我手里把他们夺去。我父把羊赐给我，祂比万有都大，谁也不能从我父手里把他们夺去。」（约10:28-29）你被两只全能的手保护着——基督的手和天父的手。\n\n3.【永远的生命不会消亡】约翰福音3:16说信的人「不致灭亡，反得永生」。如果这个生命可以失去，它就不是「永」生了。上帝的生命是永不灭亡的生命。\n\n4.【基督持续的代祷】希伯来书7:25说基督「长远活着，替他们祈求」。即使信徒软弱跌倒，基督的代祷从不停止。\n\n那些曾经看似信主后来却完全离弃的人怎么办？要么他们当初只是挂名基督徒、从未真正重生；要么他们只是暂时迷失，上帝最终会把他们带回来——就像浪子最终回到父家。真正有上帝生命的人，即使经历软弱，终会悔改归回。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "This is a question many care about. Scripture's answer is clear: those truly born again possess eternal salvation. Here's why:\n\n1. **Salvation's reliability**: Hebrews 5:9 says Christ 'became the source of eternal salvation'; 10:14 says 'by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.' Note — His merit makes salvation complete, not our performance.\n\n2. **Christ and the Father's keeping**: Jesus said: 'No one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand' (John 10:28-29). You're protected by two almighty hands — Christ's and the Father's.\n\n3. **Eternal life cannot perish**: John 3:16 says believers 'shall not perish but have eternal life.' If this life could be lost, it wouldn't be 'eternal.' God's life is imperishable.\n\n4. **Christ's ongoing intercession**: Hebrews 7:25 says Christ 'always lives to make intercession for them.' Even when believers stumble, Christ's intercession never ceases.\n\nWhat about those who seemed to believe but completely departed? Either they were never truly born again (nominal Christians), or they're temporarily lost and God will ultimately bring them back — like the prodigal son returning home. Those with genuine divine life, even through weakness, will eventually repent and return.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "许多人误以为圣灵只是一种神秘的能量或影响力，但圣经清楚表明圣灵是一个有位格的存在。\n\n1.【圣灵是位格】圣灵有智慧——祂鉴察万事（林前2:10）；有意志——祂随己意分给各人恩赐（林前12:11）；有情感——祂会担忧（弗4:30）。一股力量不会担忧，只有位格才会。耶稣称圣灵为「保惠师」（约14:16），用的是人称代词「祂」。\n\n2.【圣灵是神】彼得对欺哄圣灵的亚拿尼亚说「你不是欺哄人，是欺哄神了」（徒5:3-4），直接等同圣灵与神。圣灵无所不在（诗139:7）、无所不知（林前2:10-11）、参与创造（创1:2），这些都是神独有的属性。\n\n3.【圣灵与三一】在大使命中，耶稣吩咐奉父、子、圣灵的名施洗（太28:19），将三者并列。圣灵不是次等的神，而是与父和子同等、同荣、同永恒的一位神。\n\n理解圣灵的位格性至关重要——因为这意味着我们与圣灵的关系不是使用一种工具，而是与一位活着的神交通。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Many people mistakenly think the Holy Spirit is merely a mysterious energy or influence, but Scripture clearly shows the Spirit is a personal being.\n\n1. **The Spirit is a person**: He has intellect — He searches all things (1 Cor 2:10); will — He distributes gifts as He determines (1 Cor 12:11); emotions — He can be grieved (Eph 4:30). A force cannot grieve; only a person can. Jesus called the Spirit the 'Helper' (John 14:16), using personal pronouns.\n\n2. **The Spirit is God**: Peter told Ananias, who lied to the Holy Spirit, 'You have not lied to man but to God' (Acts 5:3-4), directly equating the Spirit with God. The Spirit is omnipresent (Ps 139:7), omniscient (1 Cor 2:10-11), and participated in creation (Gen 1:2) — all attributes unique to God.\n\n3. **The Spirit and the Trinity**: In the Great Commission, Jesus commanded baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matt 28:19), placing all three together. The Spirit is not a lesser deity but co-equal, co-glorious, and co-eternal with the Father and Son.\n\nUnderstanding the Spirit's personhood is crucial — it means our relationship with Him is not using a tool, but communing with the living God.",

Conversion isn't human willpower but the Spirit's renewal (Titus 3:5).\n\n2. **Indwelling**: After conversion, the Spirit permanently resides in believers (1 Cor 6:19), making their bodies God's temple. This isn't a temporary visit but a permanent presence.\n\n3. **Guidance and illumination**: The Spirit guides believers into all truth (John 16:13), helping us understand Scripture and discern right from wrong.\n\n4. **Power for sanctification**: The Spirit empowers believers to overcome sin (Rom 8:13), making us increasingly Christlike. Willpower alone cannot truly transform; only the Spirit can renew us from within.\n\n5. **Bearing fruit**: The Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Gal 5:22-23). These aren't products of effort but natural outflows of the Spirit's work.\n\n6. **Seal and guarantee**: The Spirit is the seal of our salvation and guarantee of our inheritance (Eph 1:13-14), ensuring believers will ultimately reach glory.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "圣灵的恩赐是上帝赐给每位信徒的属灵能力，目的是服侍教会和荣耀神。\n\n1.【恩赐的种类】圣经列出了多种恩赐：教导、服侍、劝勉、给予、治理、怜悯（罗12:6-8）、智慧的言语、知识的言语、信心、医病、行异能、预言、辨别诸灵、说方言、翻方言（林前12:8-10）。每位信徒至少有一种恩赐（彼前4:10）。\n\n2.【恩赐的目的】恩赐不是为了个人荣耀或炫耀，而是「为要成全圣徒，建立基督的身体」（弗4:12）。保罗强调最大的恩赐是爱（林前13章）。\n\n3.【是否延续？】改革宗传统中存在两种主要观点：\n- 终止论认为，使徒时代的标志性恩赐（方言、预言、神迹医治）随着使徒时代的结束和正典的完成已经停止，因为它们的主要目的是确认使徒的权柄和新启示。\n- 延续论认为，圣经没有明确说这些恩赐会停止，圣灵今天仍然自由地分赐各种恩赐。\n\n无论持何种立场，所有信徒都同意：圣灵仍然活跃地在教会中工作，赐下各样恩赐建造基督的身体。重要的是忠心使用你所领受的恩赐。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Spiritual gifts are abilities the Holy Spirit gives each believer for serving the church and glorifying God.\n\n1. **Types of gifts**: Scripture lists many gifts: teaching, serving, exhortation, giving, leadership, mercy (Rom 12:6-8), wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, tongues, interpretation (1 Cor 12:8-10). Every believer has at least one gift (1 Pet 4:10).\n\n2. **Purpose of gifts**: Gifts aren't for personal glory or display, but 'to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ' (Eph 4:12). Paul emphasizes the greatest gift is love (1 Cor 13).\n\n3. **Do they continue?** Within the Reformed tradition, two main views exist:\n- Cessationism holds that sign gifts (tongues, prophecy, miraculous healing) ceased with the apostolic era and the completion of the canon, since their primary purpose was to authenticate apostolic authority and new revelation.\n- Continuationism holds that Scripture never explicitly says these gifts will cease, and the Spirit still freely distributes all gifts today.\n\nRegardless of position, all believers agree: the Holy Spirit remains actively at work in the church, giving gifts to build up Christ's body.

Just as a drunk person is controlled by wine (Paul uses exactly this contrast in Eph 5:18), a Spirit-filled person is governed by the Spirit's influence.\n\n3. **Evidence of filling**: Spirit-filled people show several marks: praising God (Eph 5:19), giving thanks in everything (Eph 5:20), mutual submission (Eph 5:21), bearing the Spirit's fruit (Gal 5:22-23), and bold proclamation of truth (Acts 4:31).\n\n4. **How to be filled**: Spirit-filling isn't achieved by pursuing special experiences, but through confession, rooting in God's Word, persistent prayer, and faithful obedience. When we remove obstacles in our lives, the Spirit naturally fills us.\n\nCrucially: Spirit-filling isn't the privilege of a spiritual elite, but the normal state and responsibility of every believer.",

This wasn't ignorance but willful distortion of truth in the face of undeniable evidence.\n\n2. **Nature of this sin**: Blasphemy against the Spirit isn't a momentary slip or doubt, but a persistent, deliberate attitude — stubbornly attributing the Spirit's work to Satan despite full knowledge of the truth, thereby finally and completely rejecting Christ's salvation.\n\n3. **Why unforgivable?** Not because God's grace is insufficient, but because this sin closes the only channel of forgiveness.

Those who commit it are completely hardened, with no remorse or concern whatsoever. Your worry proves the Spirit is still at work in you.

He truly experienced all of humanity, yet without sin.\n\n3. **The Chalcedonian Definition**: The Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) affirmed that Christ is one person with two complete natures — divine and human — without confusion, change, division, or separation. Not 50% God plus 50% man, but 100% fully God and simultaneously 100% fully man.\n\n4. **Why it matters**: If Jesus isn't truly God, His sacrifice lacks infinite value to bear all humanity's sin.

    "detailed_answer_zh": "「道成了肉身，住在我们中间」（约1:14）——这短短一句话包含了基督教最深刻的奥秘。\n\n1.【道成肉身的含义】「道」是指永恒的神子，祂在太初就与神同在，祂就是神（约1:1）。「成了肉身」不是说神性变成了人性，而是神子在祂的神性之外，又取了完整的人性——包括人的身体、灵魂、理性和情感。\n\n2.【怎样发生的？】圣灵感孕童贞女马利亚（路1:35），使神子在没有人类父亲的情况下取了人的本性。这确保了耶稣既与人类完全认同，又不承继亚当的罪性。\n\n3.【道成肉身不是什么】道成肉身不是神「变成」人（神性并未改变或减少）；不是神「装扮成」人（人性是真实的，不是伪装）；也不是两个不同的人住在一个身体里（是一个位格）。\n\n4.【为什么必要？】希伯来书2:17说基督「凡事该与祂的弟兄相同」，才能做我们的大祭司。只有成为人，神才能在十字架上代替人受死；只有保持是神，这牺牲才有无限的功效。道成肉身是爱的最高表达——无限的神进入有限的人性，为要拯救祂所爱的人。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us' (John 1:14) — this brief sentence contains Christianity's most profound mystery.\n\n1. **What it means**: 'The Word' refers to the eternal Son of God, who was with God in the beginning and was God (John 1:1). 'Became flesh' doesn't mean deity turned into humanity, but that the Son took on complete human nature — body, soul, mind, and emotions — in addition to His divine nature.\n\n2. **How it happened**: The Holy Spirit overshadowed the virgin Mary (Luke 1:35), enabling the Son to assume human nature without a human father. This ensured Jesus fully identified with humanity yet did not inherit Adam's sinful nature.\n\n3. **What it is not**: The Incarnation isn't God 'turning into' a man (deity wasn't changed or diminished); isn't God 'disguised' as a man (humanity was real, not pretense); nor two different persons in one body (one person).\n\n4. **Why necessary**: Hebrews 2:17 says Christ had to be 'made like his brothers in every respect' to serve as our high priest. Only by becoming human could God die on the cross as our substitute; only by remaining God could this sacrifice have infinite efficacy. The Incarnation is love's highest expression — the infinite God entering finite humanity to save those He loves.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "The pre-existence of Jesus Christ is a foundational doctrine of Christianity.\n\n1. **Jesus' own claims**: Jesus said, 'Before Abraham was, I am' (John 8:58), using 'I AM' (ego eimi), God's self-designation in the Old Testament (Exod 3:14). The Jews immediately picked up stones because they understood He was claiming eternal deity. He also prayed, 'Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed' (John 17:5).\n\n2. **Creator of all things**: Colossians 1:16-17 says 'all things were created through him... he is before all things.' John 1:3 says 'all things were made through him.' He's not one among created things; He is the Creator.\n\n3. **Old Testament appearances**: Many scholars believe 'the angel of the LORD' in the OT was a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ — dining with Abraham (Gen 18), wrestling with Jacob (Gen 32), speaking to Moses from the burning bush.\n\n4. **Micah's prophecy**: Micah 5:2 prophesied the Messiah's birth in Bethlehem, adding 'whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.' One person can be born in Bethlehem yet exist from eternity — because He is the eternal God who took on human nature.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "Jesus' resurrection is not merely a faith claim but a historically testable event. Here are key lines of evidence:\n\n1. **The empty tomb**: Jesus was buried in Joseph of Arimathea's new tomb; three days later it was empty. Even Jesus' enemies didn't deny the empty tomb — they fabricated the story that disciples stole the body (Matt 28:13). But how could terrified, scattered disciples overpower Roman guards?\n\n2. **Eyewitnesses**: Paul records that the risen Christ 'appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time' (1 Cor 15:6), adding 'most of whom are still alive' — essentially inviting readers to verify. This letter was written roughly 25 years after the event, with many witnesses still living.\n\n3. **Disciples' transformation**: At Jesus' arrest, the disciples fled; Peter denied Him three times. Yet weeks later, they publicly proclaimed Christ's resurrection, willingly suffering and dying for it. People don't die for what they know is a lie.\n\n4. **Female witnesses**: All four Gospels record women as the first to discover the empty tomb. In that culture, women's testimony was inadmissible in court. If inventing a story, no one would choose women as first witnesses — unless it was simply what happened.\n\n5. **The church's birth**: Christianity was born in the very city where Jesus was executed. If the body remained, enemies needed only to produce it. They couldn't.\n\n6. **James and Paul**: Jesus' brother James was a skeptic during His life (John 7:5) but became leader of the Jerusalem church. Paul, a persecutor of Christians, became the greatest apostle. The only reasonable explanation: they truly encountered the risen Christ.",

Scripture tells us the risen, ascended Christ is actively engaged in several things:\n\n1. **Seated at God's right hand**: 'Right hand' symbolized supreme authority and honor (Eph 1:20-21). Jesus' sitting down signifies His redemptive work on the cross is complete — no further sacrifice needed. He reigns as King of kings over all creation.\n\n2. **Interceding for believers**: Hebrews 7:25 says He 'always lives to make intercession for them.' Romans 8:34 says 'Christ Jesus... is at the right hand of God... interceding for us.' Right now, in heaven, the risen Christ is praying for you. This is the ultimate guarantee of believers' preservation.\n\n3. **Building His church through the Spirit**: After ascending, Jesus sent the Spirit (John 16:7), continuing His earthly work through Him — calling sinners to repentance, equipping saints, giving gifts, growing the church.\n\n4. **Preparing a place**: Jesus said, 'I go to prepare a place for you' (John 14:2-3). He's preparing an eternal dwelling for every believer.\n\n5. **Awaiting His return**: Acts 3:21 says heaven must receive Christ 'until the time for restoring all things.'

    "detailed_answer_zh": "因信称义是基督教信仰最核心的教义，马丁·路德称之为「教会站立或跌倒的教义」。\n\n1.【什么是称义？】称义是一个法律用语，意思是法官宣告被告「无罪」。上帝不是把罪人变成义人然后宣告他们为义（那是成圣），而是在罪人仍然不完美的时候就宣告他们为义。凭什么？凭基督的义。\n\n2.【双重归算】这里有一个奇妙的交换：我们的罪归算在基督身上，祂在十字架上承担了刑罚；基督的义归算在我们身上，使我们在上帝面前被称为义（林后5:21）。这不是虚假的法律游戏，而是因为信徒与基督联合，基督的一切成为信徒的。\n\n3.【唯独信心】罗马书3:28说「人称义是因着信，不在乎遵行律法。」信心不是一种功德，而是空着的手接受上帝白白的恩典。好比一个乞丐伸手接受礼物——功劳在于给予者，不在于手。\n\n4.【唯独恩典】以弗所书2:8-9说「你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。」称义完全是上帝的工作，人无可夸口。\n\n5.【与行为的关系】雅各书2:17说「信心若没有行为就是死的。」好行为不是称义的根据，而是真信心的必然果实。得救不是因为行为，但真正的得救必然产生行为。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Justification by faith is Christianity's most central doctrine — Martin Luther called it 'the article by which the church stands or falls.'\n\n1. **What is justification?** It's a legal term meaning a judge declares the defendant 'not guilty.' God doesn't make sinners righteous and then declare them so (that's sanctification); He declares them righteous while still imperfect. On what basis? Christ's righteousness.\n\n2. **The great exchange**: Our sin is credited to Christ, who bore its penalty on the cross; Christ's righteousness is credited to us, making us righteous before God (2 Cor 5:21). This isn't a legal fiction but reality, because believers are united with Christ — all that is His becomes ours.\n\n3. **Faith alone**: Romans 3:28 says 'one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.' Faith isn't a meritorious work but an empty hand receiving God's free grace. Like a beggar extending a hand for a gift — the credit belongs to the giver, not the hand.\n\n4. **Grace alone**: Ephesians 2:8-9 says 'by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.' Justification is entirely God's work; no one can boast.\n\n5. **Relationship to works**: James 2:17 says 'faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.' Good works aren't the basis of justification but the inevitable fruit of true faith. Salvation isn't by works, but genuine salvation inevitably produces works.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "称义是一瞬间的宣告，而成圣是一生的过程。\n\n1.【成圣的定义】成圣（sanctification）来自拉丁文，意思是「使之成为圣洁」。它是上帝借着圣灵在信徒生命中持续的工作，使他们在思想、情感、意志上越来越符合基督的样式（罗8:29）。\n\n2.【信徒还会犯罪吗？】是的。约翰一书1:8说「我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺。」保罗自己也承认「我所愿意的善，我反不做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做」（罗7:19）。在今生，没有人能达到完全无罪的状态。\n\n3.【但罪不再掌权】罗马书6:14说「罪必不能作你们的主」。信主前，人是罪的奴仆，无力抵抗。信主后，虽然仍有罪的残余影响，但信徒已经有了新的本性和圣灵的能力来抵抗罪。这就像一个国家被解放了，但还有散兵游勇需要清除。\n\n4.【成圣的动力】成圣不是靠自己的努力（律法主义），也不是完全被动等候（反律主义），而是信靠上帝的恩典同时积极地顺服。保罗说「当恐惧战兢做成你们得救的工夫，因为你们立志行事都是神在你们心里运行」（腓2:12-13）。是神在工作，所以我们才能工作。\n\n5.【成圣的终点】完全的圣洁要等到荣耀化——即基督再来或信徒离世与主同在的时候。那时我们将完全像基督，再无任何罪的痕迹（约壹3:2）。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Justification is a momentary declaration; sanctification is a lifelong process.\n\n1. **Definition**: Sanctification comes from Latin meaning 'to make holy.' It's God's ongoing work through the Spirit in believers, conforming their thoughts, emotions, and will to Christ's image (Rom 8:29).\n\n2. **Do believers still sin?** Yes. 1 John 1:8 says, 'If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.' Paul himself admitted, 'The good I want to do I do not do, but the evil I do not want to do — this I keep on doing' (Rom 7:19). In this life, no one achieves sinless perfection.\n\n3. **But sin no longer reigns**: Romans 6:14 says 'sin will have no dominion over you.' Before conversion, one is sin's slave, powerless to resist. After, though sin's residual influence remains, believers have a new nature and the Spirit's power to resist. Like a liberated nation still clearing out guerrilla fighters.\n\n4. **The engine of sanctification**: It's neither self-effort (legalism) nor complete passivity (antinomianism), but trusting God's grace while actively obeying. Paul says, 'Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you' (Phil 2:12-13). Because God works, we can work.\n\n5. **Sanctification's completion**: Full holiness awaits glorification — when Christ returns or believers depart to be with the Lord. Then we'll be fully like Christ, with no trace of sin remaining (1 John 3:2).",

    "question_en": "What is predestination? Did God predetermine who would be saved?",
    "short_answer_zh": "预定论是圣经的教导：上帝在创世之前，按照自己旨意的美意，拣选了一些人得救。这不是基于神预见到他们会信，而是出于神主权的恩典。",
    "short_answer_en": "Predestination is the biblical teaching that God, before creation, chose certain people for salvation according to His good pleasure — not based on foreseen faith, but out of His sovereign grace.",
    "detailed_answer_zh": "预定论是基督教中最具争议也最深刻的教义之一，但它不是人的发明，而是圣经清楚的教导。\n\n1.【圣经的经文】以弗所书1:4-5说「神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们……又因爱我们，就按着自己旨意所喜悦的，预定我们借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分。」罗马书9:11说在雅各和以扫还没有出生、还没有行善或作恶之前，神就拣选了雅各。\n\n2.【为什么需要预定？】因为人在罪中是灵性上死的（弗2:1），无力自救。如果得救完全取决于人的选择，那么没有人会选择神——因为「没有义人，连一个也没有。没有寻求神的」（罗3:10-11）。预定是上帝的恩典主动临到那些本来不会寻求祂的人。\n\n3.【这公平吗？】罗马书9:14-21直接处理这个问题。保罗的回答不是给出人觉得满意的哲学答案，而是指出：上帝有主权按自己的旨意行事，「窑匠难道没有权柄从一团泥里拿一块做成贵重的器皿，又拿一块做成卑贱的器皿吗？」所有人都是罪人，没有人配得救恩；上帝拣选任何人都是超乎寻常的恩典。\n\n4.【预定与人的责任】预定论并不否定人的责任。圣经同时肯定两个真理：上帝主权地拣选，人也被真实地呼召来信靠基督。这两者如何调和是奥秘，但都是圣经清楚教导的。\n\n5.【预定带来的安慰】预定论给信徒的安慰是：我的得救不依赖于我的信心是否足够坚强，而是依赖于上帝在永恒中的决定。即使我软弱，上帝的拣选不会改变。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Predestination is one of Christianity's most debated yet profound doctrines — not a human invention but clear biblical teaching.\n\n1. **Scripture**: Ephesians 1:4-5 says God 'chose us in him before the foundation of the world... he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ.' Romans 9:11 says before Jacob and Esau were born or had done anything good or evil, God chose Jacob.\n\n2. **Why predestination?** Because humans are spiritually dead in sin (Eph 2:1), unable to save themselves. If salvation depended entirely on human choice, no one would choose God — 'None is righteous, no, not one... no one seeks for God' (Rom 3:10-11). Predestination is God's grace actively reaching those who would never seek Him.\n\n3. **Is it fair?** Romans 9:14-21 addresses this directly. Paul doesn't offer a satisfying philosophical answer but points out God's sovereign right: 'Has the potter no right over the clay?' All are sinners; no one deserves salvation. God choosing anyone is extraordinary grace.\n\n4. **Predestination and human responsibility**: Predestination doesn't negate human responsibility. Scripture affirms both: God sovereignly chooses, and people are genuinely called to trust Christ. How these harmonize is mysterious, but both are clearly taught.\n\n5. **Comfort of predestination**: For believers, predestination means salvation doesn't depend on whether my faith is strong enough, but on God's eternal decision. Even when I'm weak, God's choice doesn't change.",

    "short_answer_en": "Humans make real choices, but due to sin, the will is spiritually bound and unable to choose God on its own. God's sovereignty and human responsibility coexist in Scripture without contradiction.",
    "detailed_answer_zh": "「自由意志」这个词需要仔细定义，因为不同的人赋予它不同的含义。\n\n1.【人有选择能力】人可以自由选择吃什么、穿什么、做什么工作。在日常生活中，我们做的是真实的选择，而不是被迫的机器人。上帝也确实呼吁人做出选择：「今日就可以选择所要侍奉的」（书24:15）。\n\n2.【但意志不是「自由」的】改革宗神学指出，人的意志受到罪性的严重影响。人不是在善恶之间中立地自由选择，而是「按着本性行事」。耶稣说「所有犯罪的就是罪的奴仆」（约8:34）。就像一条鱼可以在水中自由游泳，但它不能「自由地」选择在陆地上行走——人也可以自由选择，但罪人不能「自由地」选择神，因为他们的本性不渴望神。\n\n3.【路德的「意志的捆绑」】马丁·路德在《论意志的捆绑》中指出：在得救的问题上，人的意志不是自由的，而是被罪捆绑的。唯有圣灵的重生才能释放人的意志，使人能够真正选择基督。\n\n4.【上帝的主权与人的责任】圣经同时教导两个真理。约瑟对出卖他的哥哥们说：「从前你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的」（创50:20）。使徒行传2:23说耶稣的死「是按着神的定旨先见」发生的，但犹大和杀害耶稣的人仍然要负完全的道德责任。\n\n5.【如何调和？】承认这是奥秘。有限的人类思维无法完全理解无限上帝的运作方式。但我们不需要选择一个而否认另一个——因为圣经明确肯定两者。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "'Free will' requires careful definition, as different people mean different things by it.\n\n1. **Humans make choices**: We freely choose what to eat, wear, and do for work. In daily life, our choices are real, not robotic. God calls people to choose: 'Choose this day whom you will serve' (Josh 24:15).\n\n2. **But the will isn't 'free'**: Reformed theology observes that human will is severely affected by sin. People don't neutrally choose between good and evil but 'act according to their nature.' Jesus said, 'Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin' (John 8:34). A fish freely swims in water but can't 'freely' walk on land — sinners freely choose, but can't 'freely' choose God because their nature doesn't desire Him.\n\n3. **Luther's 'Bondage of the Will'**: Martin Luther argued in *The Bondage of the Will* that regarding salvation, human will isn't free but bound by sin. Only the Spirit's regeneration can liberate the will to truly choose Christ.\n\n4. **Sovereignty and responsibility**: Scripture teaches both simultaneously. Joseph told his brothers: 'You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good' (Gen 50:20). Acts 2:23 says Jesus' death happened 'according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God,' yet Judas and those who killed Jesus bear full moral responsibility.\n\n5. **How to reconcile?** Accept the mystery. Finite human minds cannot fully comprehend how the infinite God operates. But we need not choose one and deny the other — Scripture clearly affirms both.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "Grace is one of Christianity's most beautiful concepts and its greatest distinction from every other religion.\n\n1. **Definition**: Grace is God's unmerited favor freely given to the undeserving. The key word is 'unmerited' — grace isn't wages, reward, or something earned. Romans 11:6 says, 'If it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.'\n\n2. **Common grace**: God gives certain graces to everyone, believer or not. Matthew 5:45 says 'he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.' This includes maintaining natural order, giving reason and creativity, restraining evil through conscience and law, and enabling human society to function. Without common grace, the world would have been destroyed long ago.\n\n3. **Special (saving) grace**: This is God's saving grace given to the elect, including:\n- Effectual calling: The Spirit opens hearts to respond to the gospel\n- Regeneration: Granting new spiritual life\n- Justification: Declaring sinners righteous\n- Sanctification: Gradually making believers holy\n- Perseverance: Keeping believers secure to the end\n- Glorification: Finally making believers fully like Christ\n\n4. **Grace changes everything**: When someone truly grasps grace, life is transformed. It eliminates pride (everything is freely given), eliminates despair (grace doesn't depend on performance), and inspires grateful obedience (responding in love, not under legal pressure).",

This is common thinking, but it reflects a misunderstanding of faith's nature.\n\n1. **Church is God's design**: Christ 'loved the church and gave himself up for her' (Eph 5:25).

God saves people not as lone rangers but as members of a new family.\n\n2. **The body metaphor**: Paul compares the church to Christ's body (1 Cor 12:12-27). A hand can't say to the foot, 'I don't need you.' Every believer is part of the body, needing each other. A Christian apart from church is like a burning coal removed from the fire — it quickly goes cold.\n\n3. **What church provides**:\n- Biblical teaching: Pastors are called to faithfully preach and teach (2 Tim 4:2)\n- Sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper are administered in community\n- Fellowship and mutual love: The NT contains 59 'one another' commands, impossible to fulfill alone\n- Spiritual accountability: Others correct you when you stray and support you when weak\n- Opportunity to use gifts: Your gifts were given to serve others\n\n4. **Biblical command**: Hebrews 10:25 directly commands 'not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some.' This isn't a suggestion but a command.\n\n5. **Church isn't perfect**: True — because it's made of sinners. But God works precisely in such imperfect community, refining and building us.

The thief on the cross received Jesus' promise 'Today you will be with me in paradise' (Luke 23:43) without baptism. Baptism is an act of post-salvation obedience, not a means of salvation.\n\n3. **Different traditions**:\n- Baptists hold that only believer's immersion is proper baptism\n- Reformed and Presbyterian churches also baptize believers' infants as a covenant sign (analogous to OT circumcision)\n- Catholic and Orthodox traditions view baptism as effecting regeneration\n\n4. **The Great Commission command**: Jesus commanded to 'baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matt 28:19).

It's not merely recalling the past but communing with the living Christ.\n- Church unity: 'Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread' (1 Cor 10:17).\n- Anticipating Christ's return: 'As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes' (1 Cor 11:26).\n\n3. **Different traditions**:\n- Catholic transubstantiation: bread and wine become Christ's actual body and blood\n- Lutheran consubstantiation: Christ's body and blood are present with the bread and wine\n- Reformed spiritual presence: Christ is truly present through the Spirit; believers receive spiritual benefits by faith\n- Memorial view: purely symbolic remembrance\n\n4. **Receive with reverence**: Paul warns against partaking in an unworthy manner (1 Cor 11:27-29), urging self-examination first. This doesn't mean perfection is required, but a heart of reverence and repentance.",

    "short_answer_en": "Denominations arise from different understandings of secondary doctrines, historical-cultural differences, and sinful divisions. But all orthodox denominations confess the same Christ and gospel — the core faith is unified.",
    "detailed_answer_zh": "基督教宗派众多确实让许多人困惑，甚至成为不信的理由。但我们需要准确地理解这个现象。\n\n1.【核心信仰的统一】所有正统基督教宗派都认信：三一上帝、基督的神人二性、因信称义、圣经的权威、基督的复活和再来。使徒信经、尼西亚信经是所有正统教会共同承认的。分歧不在核心福音，而在次要问题上。\n\n2.【分歧的原因】\n- 对次要教义的不同理解：比如洗礼的方式（浸水还是洒水）、教会治理（主教制、长老制、会众制）、对末世的理解等。这些是真实的分歧，但不涉及救恩的核心。\n- 历史和文化因素：东西方教会1054年大分裂、16世纪宗教改革、各地文化对信仰表达的影响。\n- 人的罪性：骄傲、权力欲望、个人冲突确实导致了一些不该有的分裂。\n\n3.【宗派不等于分裂】有些宗派差异更像是同一支军队的不同兵种——步兵、骑兵、炮兵各有特色但同属一军。不同宗派在敬拜风格、组织形式、神学侧重上各有特色，可以彼此互补。\n\n4.【耶稣的祷告】耶稣为信徒的合一祷告（约17:21），这提醒我们追求合一是重要的。但真正的合一不是组织上的统一，而是在真理和爱中的合一。为了维护真理而分开（如宗教改革），有时是必要的。\n\n5.【给慕道友的建议】不要因为宗派多就否定基督教——这就像因为有很多种医学专科就否定医学一样。关键是核心真理是否可靠，而所有正统宗派对核心真理的见证是一致的。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "The multitude of denominations genuinely confuses many, even becoming a reason for unbelief. But we need to understand this phenomenon accurately.\n\n1. **Core unity**: All orthodox denominations confess the Triune God, Christ's two natures, justification by faith, Scripture's authority, and Christ's resurrection and return. The Apostles' and Nicene Creeds are universally acknowledged. Disagreements concern secondary matters, not the core gospel.\n\n2. **Reasons for differences**:\n- Different understandings of secondary doctrines: baptism method (immersion vs. sprinkling), church governance (episcopal, presbyterian, congregational), eschatology, etc. Real differences, but not touching salvation's core.\n- Historical-cultural factors: the East-West Schism of 1054, the 16th-century Reformation, cultural influences on faith expression.\n- Human sinfulness: Pride, power struggles, and personal conflicts have caused some unnecessary divisions.\n\n3. **Denominations ≠ division**: Some denominational differences are like different branches of the same military — infantry, cavalry, artillery each with distinct features but belonging to one army. Different denominations complement each other in worship style, organization, and theological emphasis.\n\n4. **Jesus' prayer**: Jesus prayed for believers' unity (John 17:21), reminding us unity matters. But true unity isn't organizational uniformity but unity in truth and love. Separating to preserve truth (as in the Reformation) is sometimes necessary.\n\n5. **For seekers**: Don't dismiss Christianity because of many denominations — that's like dismissing medicine because of many specialties. The key question is whether the core truth is reliable, and all orthodox denominations testify consistently to that core.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "教会纪律是一个常被忽视但圣经明确教导的重要主题。\n\n1.【圣经的教导】耶稣在马太福音18:15-17中给出了清楚的步骤：\n- 第一步：私下指出对方的罪\n- 第二步：如果不听，带一两个见证人去\n- 第三步：如果仍不听，告诉教会\n- 第四步：如果连教会也不听，就把他看作外邦人和税吏——即从教会团契中除名\n\n2.【纪律的目的】\n- 挽回犯罪的弟兄：「你们这属灵的人就当用温柔的心把他挽回过来」（加6:1）。目标不是赶走人，而是让人悔改回转。\n- 保护教会：「一点面酵能使全团发起来」（林前5:6）。不处理的罪会像酵一样影响整个教会。\n- 维护基督的荣耀：教会是基督的见证，持续容忍公开的罪会玷污基督的名。\n\n3.【什么情况需要纪律？】不是每个罪都需要正式纪律。保罗在哥林多前书5章处理的是公开、严重、且不悔改的罪。关键词是「不悔改」——如果有人犯了罪但真心悔改，教会应当赦免和接纳（林后2:6-8）。\n\n4.【纪律需要智慧和爱】教会纪律不是专制的权力工具，而是牧养关怀的一部分。它需要：清楚的圣经依据、正当的程序、温柔而坚定的态度、始终以恢复为目标。滥用教会纪律是严重的罪，但完全忽视教会纪律同样是不忠于基督的托付。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Church discipline is an important but often neglected biblical teaching.\n\n1. **Biblical instruction**: Jesus gives clear steps in Matthew 18:15-17:\n- Step 1: Point out the sin privately\n- Step 2: If unheeded, bring one or two witnesses\n- Step 3: If still unheeded, tell the church\n- Step 4: If even the church is ignored, treat the person as an outsider — removal from church fellowship\n\n2. **Purposes**:\n- Restoring the sinning member: 'You who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness' (Gal 6:1). The goal isn't expulsion but repentance.\n- Protecting the church: 'A little leaven leavens the whole lump' (1 Cor 5:6). Unaddressed sin spreads like yeast.\n- Upholding Christ's honor: The church is Christ's witness; tolerating open sin tarnishes His name.\n\n3. **When is discipline needed?** Not every sin requires formal discipline. Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 addresses public, serious, unrepentant sin. The key word is 'unrepentant' — if someone sins but genuinely repents, the church should forgive and restore (2 Cor 2:6-8).\n\n4. **Discipline requires wisdom and love**: Church discipline isn't an authoritarian power tool but part of pastoral care. It requires: clear biblical basis, due process, a gentle yet firm attitude, and restoration as the constant goal. Abusing church discipline is a grave sin, but completely neglecting it is equally unfaithful to Christ's charge.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them' (Gen 1:27). This statement is the foundation of human dignity and worth.\n\n1. **Not physical resemblance**: God's image doesn't mean humans look like God — God is spirit (John 4:24), without a physical body. Image (imago Dei) refers to functional and relational likeness.\n\n2. **Content of the image**:\n- Rationality: capacity for thought, reasoning, and knowing truth\n- Moral awareness: conscience, ability to distinguish good and evil\n- Relationality: God is Trinity, inherently relational; humans are also created as relational beings needing connection with God and others\n- Creativity: ability to create art, music, literature, technology, reflecting the Creator's creativity\n- Dominion mandate: God gave humans responsibility to steward the earth (Gen 1:28) as His representatives\n\n3. **Sin's effect**: After the Fall, God's image was severely distorted but not entirely lost. Humans still possess reason and conscience (Gen 9:6 still bases the prohibition of murder on the image of God), but these capacities are corrupted by sin. Humans no longer perfectly reflect God but do so in distorted ways.\n\n4. **Restored in Christ**: Colossians 3:10 says believers have 'put on the new self, which is being renewed... after the image of its creator.' Christ is 'the exact imprint of [God's] nature' (Heb 1:3), and sanctification is becoming increasingly Christlike — restoring the image we were meant to bear.\n\n5. **Practical implications**: Every person — regardless of race, ability, age, or social status — possesses dignity from God's image.

    "short_answer_en": "Original sin means that because of Adam's fall, all humans are born with a sinful nature — not just learned bad habits, but inherent corruption. Infants, though they haven't committed actual sins, still inherit this sinful nature.",
    "detailed_answer_zh": "原罪是基督教人论中最基本也最具挑战性的教义之一。\n\n1.【亚当的代表性】罗马书5:12说「罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的；于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪。」亚当不仅仅是第一个人，更是全人类的代表。他犯罪的后果归算到所有后代身上——就像一个国家元首的决定影响全体国民。\n\n2.【罪性vs罪行】原罪不是指某个具体的罪行，而是一种内在的状态——倾向于自我中心、远离上帝的败坏本性。诗篇51:5说「我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎的时候就有了罪。」这不是说出生的过程有罪，而是说罪性从受孕就开始了。\n\n3.【婴儿有罪吗？】从原罪的角度看，婴儿同样继承了亚当的罪性。这不是说婴儿做了什么坏事，而是他们的本性已经受到罪的污染。这解释了为什么不需要教孩子撒谎或自私——这些是自然就会的。\n\n4.【婴儿的永恒命运】圣经没有给出完全明确的答案。但大多数改革宗神学家相信，夭折的婴儿蒙恩得救。大卫在婴儿死后说「我必往他那里去」（撒下12:23），暗示他相信会在天堂再见。上帝的恩典不受年龄限制。\n\n5.【为什么这教义重要？】如果人本性是好的，只是后天被环境带坏，那我们只需要改善环境和教育。但如果人的本性本身就有问题，那我们需要的是从内而外的彻底更新——这正是福音所提供的。原罪的教义是理解救恩必要性的前提。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Original sin is one of Christianity's most fundamental and challenging doctrines.\n\n1. **Adam's representation**: Romans 5:12 says, 'Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned.' Adam wasn't merely the first human but humanity's representative. His sin's consequences are imputed to all descendants — like a head of state whose decisions affect all citizens.\n\n2. **Sinful nature vs. sinful acts**: Original sin isn't a specific sinful act but an inner condition — a corrupt nature inclined toward self-centeredness and away from God. Psalm 51:5 says, 'Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.' This doesn't mean birth is sinful but that the sinful nature begins at conception.\n\n3. **Are babies sinful?** From original sin's perspective, infants inherit Adam's sinful nature. Not that they've done bad things, but their nature is already corrupted by sin. This explains why children don't need to be taught to lie or be selfish — it comes naturally.\n\n4. **Infants' eternal destiny**: Scripture doesn't give a fully explicit answer. But most Reformed theologians believe infants who die are saved by grace. David said after his infant's death, 'I shall go to him' (2 Sam 12:23), suggesting he believed they'd reunite in heaven. God's grace isn't limited by age.\n\n5. **Why this doctrine matters**: If humans are naturally good, corrupted only by environment, we just need better education and conditions. But if human nature itself is flawed, we need radical renewal from within — exactly what the gospel provides. Original sin is the prerequisite for understanding salvation's necessity.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "Angels appear nearly 300 times in Scripture, forming an important part of God's created order.\n\n1. **Nature of angels**: Angels are spirits (Heb 1:14), created by God (Col 1:16), vast in number (Heb 12:22 mentions 'innumerable angels'). They possess wisdom and power but aren't omniscient or omnipotent — only God is. They lack physical bodies but can appear in human form (Gen 18-19).\n\n2. **Angels' work**:\n- Praising and worshiping God: Isaiah saw seraphim crying 'Holy, holy, holy!' (Isa 6:3)\n- Delivering God's messages: Gabriel announced Jesus' birth to Mary (Luke 1:26-38)\n- Protecting and serving believers: 'Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?' (Heb 1:14). Psalm 91:11 says God 'will command his angels... to guard you.'\n- Executing God's judgment: Angels carry out many judgments in Revelation. In the OT, one angel struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in one night (2 Kings 19:35).\n\n3. **Don't worship angels**: Colossians 2:18 warns against 'worship of angels.' In Revelation, when John fell at an angel's feet, the angel stopped him: 'You must not do that! I am a fellow servant... Worship God!' (Rev 22:8-9)\n\n4. **Guardian angels?** Jesus mentioned angels watching over children (Matt 18:10), leading some to believe each person has a dedicated guardian angel. Scripture doesn't explicitly confirm this, but does teach that angels collectively protect and serve believers.\n\n5. **Angels vs. humans**: Angels aren't deceased humans transformed. Humans and angels are different kinds of creatures. Believers will even judge angels (1 Cor 6:3), because redemptive grace is given to humans, not angels — what glory!",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "魔鬼的来源是一个许多人好奇的问题。圣经没有给出完整的叙事，但提供了足够的线索。\n\n1.【撒但的起源】上帝创造的一切都是好的（创1:31），所以撒但最初也是善的受造物。以赛亚书14:12-15和以西结书28:12-17（虽然直接针对巴比伦王和推罗王，但传统上被理解为隐射撒但的堕落）描述了一个原本美丽、智慧的存在因骄傲而堕落：「你心里曾说：我要升到天上……我要与至上者同等。」\n\n2.【堕落的原因】撒但的罪是骄傲——不满足于做受造物，想要成为上帝。这也是他试探夏娃的把戏：「你们便如神」（创3:5）。骄傲是一切罪的根源。\n\n3.【他带走了其他天使】犹大书6节提到「不守本位的天使」，启示录12:4象征性地说龙（撒但）的尾巴「拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一」。一些天使跟随撒但叛逆，成为邪灵或鬼魔。\n\n4.【撒但不是上帝的对等物】基督教不是二元论——善神与恶神的永恒对抗。撒但是受造物，他的能力、知识和存在都是有限的。他只能在上帝允许的范围内行动（约伯记1-2章清楚地表明这一点）。\n\n5.【撒但的结局已定】启示录20:10宣告撒但最终将被「扔在硫磺的火湖里……直到永永远远。」基督在十字架上已经「将一切执政的、掌权的掳来」（西2:15）。撒但是一个已经被判了死刑但还没执行的罪犯——他的挣扎只是垂死的挣扎。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "Satan's origin is a question many are curious about. Scripture doesn't provide a complete narrative but gives sufficient clues.\n\n1. **Satan's origin**: Everything God created was good (Gen 1:31), so Satan was originally a good creature. Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:12-17 (addressed directly to kings of Babylon and Tyre but traditionally understood as alluding to Satan's fall) describe a beautiful, wise being who fell through pride: 'You said in your heart, \"I will ascend to heaven... I will make myself like the Most High.\"'\n\n2. **Cause of the fall**: Satan's sin was pride — dissatisfaction with being a creature, wanting to be God. This is exactly his temptation to Eve: 'You will be like God' (Gen 3:5). Pride is the root of all sin.\n\n3. **He took other angels with him**: Jude 6 mentions 'angels who did not stay within their own position'; Revelation 12:4 symbolically says the dragon's tail 'swept down a third of the stars of heaven.' Some angels followed Satan in rebellion, becoming evil spirits or demons.\n\n4. **Satan isn't God's equal**: Christianity isn't dualism — an eternal battle between equal good and evil gods. Satan is a creature whose power, knowledge, and existence are limited. He can only act within boundaries God allows (Job 1-2 makes this clear).\n\n5. **Satan's fate is sealed**: Revelation 20:10 declares Satan will ultimately be 'thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur... forever and ever.' Christ on the cross already 'disarmed the rulers and authorities' (Col 2:15). Satan is a criminal sentenced to death but not yet executed — his struggle is merely a death throe.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "基督徒的生命不是一条轻松的路，而是一场属灵的战争。但好消息是：胜利已经确定。\n\n1.【三个敌人】基督徒面对三个属灵的敌人：\n- 肉体（罪性）：即使重生后，旧的罪性仍在，与新本性争战（加5:17）\n- 世界：不是指地球，而是与上帝为敌的价值体系和文化压力（约壹2:15-16）\n- 魔鬼：「你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人」（彼前5:8）\n\n2.【神的军装】以弗所书6:10-18是属灵争战的经典经文。保罗列出了六件军装：\n- 真理的腰带：以上帝的真理对抗撒但的谎言\n- 公义的护心镜：基督归算给我们的义保护我们免受控告\n- 福音的鞋子：随时预备好传讲和平的福音\n- 信心的盾牌：抵挡一切怀疑和试探的火箭\n- 救恩的头盔：对救恩确据的确信保护我们的思想\n- 圣灵的宝剑——神的道：唯一的进攻性武器，就是圣经的话语\n\n3.【祷告是关键】保罗在列出军装之后紧接着说「靠着圣灵，随时多方祷告祈求」（弗6:18）。属灵争战最根本的武器是祷告。耶稣在客西马尼园对门徒说「总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑」（太26:41）。\n\n4.【平衡的态度】基督徒应该避免两个极端：一是完全忽视属灵争战，以为一切问题都是心理或物质原因；二是过度关注魔鬼，把一切事情都归于邪灵，忽视个人责任。C.S.路易斯说：「关于魔鬼有两种同样严重且相反的错误。一种是不相信他们存在。另一种是过度地、不健康地关注他们。」\n\n5.【胜利的确据】「那在你们里面的，比那在世界上的更大」（约壹4:4）。基督已经在十字架上击败了一切黑暗权势（西2:15），信徒是站在已经胜利的一方。我们不是为胜利而战，而是从胜利出发而战。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "The Christian life isn't an easy road but a spiritual battle. The good news: victory is already certain.\n\n1. **Three enemies**: Christians face three spiritual foes:\n- The flesh (sinful nature): Even after regeneration, the old nature wars against the new (Gal 5:17)\n- The world: Not the earth, but the value system and cultural pressures hostile to God (1 John 2:15-16)\n- The devil: 'Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour' (1 Pet 5:8)\n\n2. **God's armor**: Ephesians 6:10-18 is the classic spiritual warfare passage. Paul lists six pieces of armor:\n- Belt of truth: Countering Satan's lies with God's truth\n- Breastplate of righteousness: Christ's imputed righteousness protecting against accusation\n- Shoes of the gospel: Readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace\n- Shield of faith: Deflecting all fiery darts of doubt and temptation\n- Helmet of salvation: Assurance of salvation protecting our minds\n- Sword of the Spirit — God's Word: The only offensive weapon, Scripture itself\n\n3. **Prayer is key**: After listing the armor, Paul immediately says 'praying at all times in the Spirit' (Eph 6:18). Prayer is the most fundamental weapon. Jesus told disciples in Gethsemane, 'Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation' (Matt 26:41).\n\n4. **Balanced approach**: Christians should avoid two extremes: completely ignoring spiritual warfare (assuming all problems are psychological or material), or over-focusing on the devil (attributing everything to demons, ignoring personal responsibility). C.S. Lewis said: 'There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.'\n\n5. **Assured victory**: 'He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world' (1 John 4:4). Christ defeated all dark powers on the cross (Col 2:15). Believers stand on the winning side. We don't fight for victory but from victory.",

That longing, that restlessness, that yearning for truth — none of it is accidental. It is God calling you.\n\nFaith doesn't require you to become strong first. Jesus said, 'It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick' (Matthew 9:12). You don't need to come to God with courage — just come with your weakness and honesty. You can pray like the father who said, 'I believe; help my unbelief!' (Mark 9:24).\n\nWhat holds you back may be fear of the unknown, anxiety about change, or worry about others' reactions.

The second commandment forbids 'making and bowing down to images,' using visible things to represent and worship God (Exodus 20:4-5).\n\n**The Reformed position** strictly upholds the second commandment:\n\n1. **The cross as symbol**: Just as a national flag symbolizes a country without being worshiped, the cross can serve as a Christian symbol reminding us of Christ's sacrifice. But we don't pray to crosses, kiss them, or attribute magical powers to them.\n\n2. **Icons and statues**: Reformed churches generally do not use icons in worship settings, as they easily lead to idolatry. Historically, Catholic and Orthodox churches permitted icons as 'teaching tools,' but the Reformed view considers this a violation of the second commandment.\n\n3. **Idols of the heart**: The most fundamental idols aren't wood and stone but anything in the heart that displaces God — money, fame, relationships, even religious rituals themselves.

    "detailed_answer_en": "Feeling that 'believe and be saved' is too simple actually reflects a deep-seated notion: we must earn good things through our own effort. But this is exactly where the gospel overturns human thinking.\n\n**Why is salvation 'simple'?**\n\n1. **The price has already been paid.** Salvation is free for us but never cheap. Jesus Christ — the sinless Son of God — bore all of humanity's sin and suffered the punishment we deserved on the cross (Isaiah 53:5). This was the most costly price in the universe.\n\n2. **Humans cannot save themselves.** If salvation required works, no one could qualify (Romans 3:23). God designed salvation as 'justification by faith' not because He lowered the standard, but because only Christ could meet it.\n\n3. **'Simple' doesn't mean 'easy.'** Accepting the gospel requires admitting you're a sinner who needs a Savior — the hardest thing for a proud person. Admitting you cannot save yourself is harder than doing a thousand good deeds.\n\nLike a drowning person who doesn't need to learn to swim to be rescued — they just need to grab the outstretched hand. The 'simplicity' of salvation reveals the greatness of God's grace: He did everything; we only need to receive.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "The Greek word for 'repentance' is metanoia, meaning 'a fundamental change of mind.' It's not merely regretting something but a complete redirection of life.\n\n**Repentance involves three dimensions:**\n\n1. **Cognitive**: Recognizing that you have sinned against God, not just regretting bad consequences. After his sin, David said to God: 'Against you, you only, have I sinned' (Psalm 51:4).\n\n2. **Emotional**: Genuine sorrow over sin. But 'godly grief' differs from 'worldly grief' (2 Corinthians 7:10) — the former leads to life transformation, the latter is mere self-pity.\n\n3. **Volitional**: A decision to turn from sin toward God. This doesn't mean instant perfection but a fundamental change of direction.\n\n**Common misconceptions:**\n\n- Repentance doesn't equal weeping. Some cry without real change; others are quiet yet have truly turned to God.\n- Repentance isn't a one-time event but a lifelong Christian posture. Martin Luther's first of the 95 Theses states: 'When our Lord said \"Repent,\" He meant the entire life of believers should be one of repentance.'\n- Repentance is also a gift from God (2 Timothy 2:25), not purely a product of human willpower.",

If the apostle Paul experienced such struggle, we need not doubt our faith because of imperfection.\n\n**Distinguish two situations:**\n\n1. **Struggling but growing**: Still sinning, but grieved by sin, desiring change, with life's overall direction toward Christ — this is normal sanctification.\n\n2. **No change and no concern**: Absolutely no sign of change after professing faith, no sensitivity to sin, no desire for God — this warrants serious self-examination of whether one's faith is genuine (James 2:17).\n\nGrace is not a license to keep sinning, but neither is it a contract conditioned on perfection.

'To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God' (John 1:12). If you genuinely trust Christ, God's Word guarantees your salvation. This doesn't depend on your feelings but on God's faithful promises.\n\n2. **The Holy Spirit's inner witness**: 'The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God' (Romans 8:16). The Holy Spirit dwells in believers, giving us an inner assurance — an intimacy that cries 'Abba! Father!'\n\n3. **The fruit of life**: True faith bears fruit. Do you have a new sensitivity to sin? A hunger for God's Word? A love for other believers? Have you experienced inner transformation? These are signs of life change (1 John 3:14).\n\n**On doubt:**\nOccasional doubt doesn't mean you're unsaved. Faith and doubt can coexist (Mark 9:24). Satan often attacks believers' assurance. When you doubt, return to God's Word and hold onto His promises rather than relying on your feelings.\n\nThe Westminster Confession states: 'This infallible assurance may take time and effort to attain, but this does not prevent a true believer from being truly saved before achieving such assurance.'",

    "short_answer_zh": "「基督」是希腊文，意为「受膏者」，等同于希伯来文的「弥赛亚」。说「耶稣是基督」就是宣告拿撒勒人耶稣就是旧约预言的那位神所差遣的救世主。",
    "short_answer_en": "'Christ' is Greek for 'Anointed One,' equivalent to the Hebrew 'Messiah.' To say 'Jesus is the Christ' is to proclaim that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Savior sent by God, foretold in the Old Testament.",
    "detailed_answer_zh": "「耶稣」是他的名字（意为「耶和华拯救」），「基督」是他的头衔（意为「受膏者」）。\n\n在旧约中，先知、祭司和君王就职时要被膏抹（用油倒在头上），象征被神分别为圣、赋予特殊使命。旧约预言将来会有一位终极的「受膏者」，集先知、祭司、君王三职于一身：\n\n1. **先知**：祂完美地向人启示神的旨意。「神在古时借众先知多次多方晓谕列祖，就在这末世借着他儿子晓谕我们」（希伯来书1:1-2）。\n\n2. **祭司**：祂不是献动物为祭，而是献上自己作为完美的赎罪祭。「他只一次将自己献上，就把这事成全了」（希伯来书7:27）。\n\n3. **君王**：祂是万王之王，统管万有。祂的国度不是属世的政权，而是永恒的属灵国度（路加福音1:33）。\n\n耶稣在世时，彼得的伟大宣告就是：「你是基督，是永生神的儿子」（马太福音16:16）。这个认信是全部基督教信仰的基石。认耶稣为基督，就是承认祂是神为拯救人类所差遣的那位独一无二的救主。",

The OT prophesied a coming ultimate 'Anointed One' who would unite all three offices:\n\n1. **Prophet**: He perfectly reveals God's will. 'Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son' (Hebrews 1:1-2).\n\n2. **Priest**: He offers not animal sacrifices but Himself as the perfect atonement. 'He did this once for all when he offered up himself' (Hebrews 7:27).\n\n3. **King**: He is King of kings, ruling over all. His kingdom is not an earthly government but an eternal spiritual kingdom (Luke 1:33).\n\nPeter's great confession was: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God' (Matthew 16:16).

New believers should start with Mark (shortest Gospel) or John to learn about Jesus' life and teaching.\n\n2. **Pray for illumination**: Before reading, pray: 'Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law' (Psalm 119:18). The Holy Spirit is the best teacher.\n\n3. **Join a church and Bible study group**: God established the church for believers to build each other up. Group study is far more effective than solitary exploration. Pastors' and elders' teaching is a gift God gives the church.\n\n4. **Use study aids**: Good study Bibles, commentaries, and catechisms (Heidelberg, Westminster Shorter) are excellent helps.\n\n5. **Interpret Scripture with Scripture**: Use clear passages to explain unclear ones; understand individual texts in light of the whole. Don't interpret verses in isolation.\n\n6. **Persevere**: Understanding grows with spiritual maturity. Set aside what you don't yet understand, grasp what you can, and clarity will come with time.",

    "detailed_answer_en": "Reformed theology traditionally analyzes faith into three elements (Latin: notitia, assensus, fiducia):\n\n1. **Knowledge (Notitia)**: Faith requires content. You must know what the gospel says — who Jesus is, what He did, why you need Him. Faith without knowledge is superstition.\n\n2. **Assent (Assensus)**: Not just knowing but affirming it as true. Demons also 'believe' there is one God, but merely know the facts (James 2:19).\n\n3. **Trust (Fiducia)**: This is the heart of faith. Not just believing facts about Jesus but entrusting yourself — your sin, your life, your eternity — to Him. It's the difference between knowing a chair can hold your weight (knowledge + assent) and actually sitting in it (trust).\n\n**The Heidelberg Catechism Q21** defines faith beautifully: 'True faith is not only a sure knowledge by which I hold as true all that God has revealed to us in Scripture; it is also a wholehearted trust, which the Holy Spirit creates in me by the gospel, that not only others but I too have had my sins forgiven, have been made right with God forever, and have been granted salvation.'\n\nFaith is not something humans can produce on their own — it's a gift of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:8).

Christian civilization has been among the most creative and ambitious in human history.\n\n**What is truly 'passive'?**\nIf a person's life consists only of earning money, seeking pleasure, and dying — that is the real nihilism and passivity.

    "detailed_answer_en": "The quote 'religion is the opium of the people' is from Marx, but it must be understood in its full context.\n\n**First, clarifying Marx's original meaning:**\nIn Marx's full text, 'opium' wasn't entirely pejorative — opium was the only affordable painkiller for the poor at the time. He meant religion comforted the suffering, but this comfort prevented people from changing unjust social systems.\n\n**But this critique doesn't hold for genuine Christianity:**\n\n1. **Christianity has driven social transformation:**\n   - Early Christians changed Roman attitudes toward infant abandonment and gladiatorial games\n   - Wilberforce pushed to abolish the slave trade because of his Christian faith\n   - Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement was deeply rooted in Christianity\n   - Modern hospitals, universities, and charities were largely built by Christians\n\n2. **The counter-witness of atheistic regimes:**\n   20th-century regimes that abolished religion (Soviet Union, Khmer Rouge, Cultural Revolution) produced the largest-scale persecution and suffering in human history. Eliminating religion didn't liberate humanity but brought greater oppression.\n\n3. **The Bible's social concern:**\n   'He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God' (Micah 6:8). True faith isn't escape but active engagement in transforming the world.\n\nChristian faith gives individuals dignity (humans made in God's image), gives society an ethical foundation (objective moral standards), and gives the suffering hope (not false comfort but eternal promise).",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "这个问题反映了一种常见但错误的假设：不说谎就做不好生意。让我们来分析一下。\n\n**1. 圣经对诚实的要求是绝对的。**\n「你们的话，是就说是，不是就说不是」（马太福音5:37）。「说谎言的嘴为耶和华所憎恶；行事诚实的为他所喜悦」（箴言12:22）。这不是建议，而是命令。\n\n**2. 但诚实不等于愚蠢。**\n诚实不是说每件事都要告诉所有人，也不是不能有商业策略。诚实是指不用欺骗手段获利——不虚假宣传、不欺诈客户、不违背承诺。你完全可以精明、策略性地经商，同时保持诚信。\n\n**3. 诚信是最好的长期策略。**\n谎言可能带来短期利益，但长期来看，信誉才是最大的资产。很多成功的企业恰恰是建立在信任和口碑之上的。「诚实人的纯正必引导自己」（箴言11:3）。\n\n**4. 信仰改变你对成功的定义。**\n如果你的目标是不择手段赚更多钱，那确实与信仰冲突。但基督教会帮你重新定义成功——不是赚多少钱，而是你是否忠于神的呼召，是否做了有价值的事。\n\n**5. 这是一个信靠神的问题。**\n根本的挣扎在于：你是否相信按照神的方式做事，神会供应你的需要？「你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了」（马太福音6:33）。\n\n确实会有难处，可能需要放弃某些不正当的利润。但你得到的远比失去的多——清洁的良心、神的祝福、和真正的平安。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "This question reflects a common but false assumption: you can't succeed in business without lying. Let's examine this.\n\n**1. Scripture's demand for honesty is absolute.**\n'Let your yes be yes and your no be no' (Matthew 5:37). 'Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight' (Proverbs 12:22). These aren't suggestions — they're commands.\n\n**2. But honesty doesn't mean naivety.**\nHonesty doesn't require telling everyone everything or prohibit business strategy. It means not profiting through deception — no false advertising, no defrauding customers, no breaking promises. You can be shrewd and strategic while maintaining integrity.\n\n**3. Integrity is the best long-term strategy.**\nLies may yield short-term gains, but long-term, reputation is your greatest asset. Many successful businesses are built precisely on trust and word-of-mouth. 'The integrity of the upright guides them' (Proverbs 11:3).\n\n**4. Faith redefines success.**\nIf your goal is making money by any means necessary, that conflicts with faith. But Christianity helps you redefine success — not how much you earn but whether you're faithful to God's calling and doing something of value.\n\n**5. This is a question of trusting God.**\nThe fundamental struggle is: do you believe that doing things God's way means God will provide for your needs? 'Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you' (Matthew 6:33).\n\nThere will be difficulties — you may need to forgo some illegitimate profits. But what you gain far exceeds what you lose: a clean conscience, God's blessing, and true peace.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "这是最常见的福音疑问之一，触及了公义与恩典的核心张力。\n\n**1. 圣经对「好人」的定义可能跟你不同。**\n人衡量好坏通常是和其他人比较。但神的标准是祂自己的完美：「你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样」（马太福音5:48）。按这个标准，「没有义人，连一个也没有」（罗马书3:10）。所谓的「好人」在神面前同样是罪人——只是罪的表现形式不同。\n\n**2. 救恩不是「奖赏」而是「恩典」。**\n如果救恩是按行为分配的奖金，那确实应该给「好人」。但救恩是对死刑犯的赦免——不是你赚来的，而是白白给的。一个欠了十亿的人和欠了一百万的人，都无力偿还，都同样需要免债的恩典。\n\n**3. 公义已经在十字架上得到了满足。**\n有人说：「上帝直接赦罪不就好了？为什么要耶稣死？」正是因为上帝是公义的，罪的代价必须有人付。耶稣在十字架上代替罪人承受了刑罚——这是最高的公义。因此，赦免罪人不是不公义，而是在公义已被满足之后的恩典。\n\n**4. 每个人都有同等的机会。**\n福音向所有人发出邀请：「凡愿意的，都可以白白取生命的水喝」（启示录22:17）。「好人」如果愿意放下自义来到基督面前，同样会被接纳。如果他拒绝，不是因为神不公平，而是他选择了骄傲。\n\n**5. 耶稣讲过一个直击这个问题的比喻。**\n浪子的比喻（路加福音15章）中，大儿子就是觉得不公平——他辛辛苦苦做「好人」，弟弟犯了大错回来却受到欢迎。但父亲的回答是：「你常和我同在，我一切所有的都是你的。」恩典不是对好人的亏待，而是对罪人的怜悯。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "This is one of the most common gospel objections, touching the core tension between justice and grace.\n\n**1. The Bible's definition of 'good' may differ from yours.**\nHumans typically measure goodness by comparing with others. But God's standard is His own perfection: 'You must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect' (Matthew 5:48). By this standard, 'None is righteous, no, not one' (Romans 3:10). So-called 'good people' are still sinners before God — just with different expressions of sin.\n\n**2. Salvation is not a 'reward' but 'grace.'**\nIf salvation were a performance bonus, it should indeed go to 'good people.' But salvation is a pardon for death-row inmates — not earned but freely given. Someone who owes a billion and someone who owes a million are both unable to repay and equally need the grace of debt cancellation.\n\n**3. Justice was fully satisfied at the cross.**\nSome ask: 'Why didn't God just forgive directly? Why did Jesus have to die?' Precisely because God is just — sin's price must be paid. Jesus bore the punishment for sinners on the cross — this is the highest justice. Forgiving sinners isn't unjust but grace after justice has been satisfied.\n\n**4. Everyone has equal opportunity.**\nThe gospel invites all: 'Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price' (Revelation 22:17). If a 'good person' is willing to set aside self-righteousness and come to Christ, they'll be equally accepted. If they refuse, it's not God's unfairness but their own pride.\n\n**5. Jesus told a parable directly addressing this.**\nIn the Prodigal Son (Luke 15), the older brother felt it was unfair — he worked hard being 'good' while his sinful brother returned to a celebration. The father's answer: 'You are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.' Grace isn't mistreatment of the good — it's mercy toward sinners.",

    "detailed_answer_zh": "「等有感动再信」是很多人的想法，但这里有几个需要纠正的误解。\n\n**1. 信心的对象是真理，不是感觉。**\n你坐上飞机，不需要先「感动」才相信飞机能飞——你相信的是飞行的物理原理和工程设计。同样，基督教信仰的基础是历史事实（基督的死和复活）和神的应许，不是你一时的情感体验。\n\n**2. 感动是主观的，可以被操控。**\n有些宗教环境刻意营造氛围来制造「感动」——灯光、音乐、群体压力。但这种情感可能只是心理反应，不等于真正的信心。相反，安静理性地认识真理、做出信靠的决定，比一时的感动更加可靠。\n\n**3. 「感动」往往在信之后才来。**\n很多基督徒的经历是：先在理性上接受福音的真理，凭信心回应；然后在信主之后，通过读经、祷告和教会生活，逐渐经历到神同在的真实感受。先行动，感觉会跟上来。\n\n**4. 如果你在等「感动」，问问自己：你在等什么样的感动？**\n是雷轰闪电的超自然体验？还是内心深处的平安？也许神对你的「感动」就是此刻让你思考这些问题——这本身不就是圣灵在工作的迹象吗？\n\n**5. 拖延本身就是一个选择。**\n不做决定也是一种决定——是选择留在远离神的状态中。「你们今日若听他的话，就不可硬着心」（希伯来书3:7-8）。\n\n马丁·路德说：「信心是一场冒险——把自己完全交托给一位你看不见的神。」不要等感觉完美了再迈出这一步。信心的火车头是事实，车厢是信心，守车是感觉——不要让守车拉火车。",
    "detailed_answer_en": "'I'll wait for a spiritual stirring' is a common sentiment, but several misconceptions need correcting.\n\n**1. Faith's object is truth, not feelings.**\nWhen you board a plane, you don't need to 'feel moved' to believe it can fly — you trust the physics and engineering. Similarly, Christian faith is grounded in historical facts (Christ's death and resurrection) and God's promises, not momentary emotional experiences.\n\n**2. Feelings are subjective and can be manipulated.**\nSome religious settings deliberately create atmosphere to produce 'stirrings' — lighting, music, group pressure. But such emotions may be merely psychological responses, not genuine faith. A quiet, rational recognition of truth followed by a decision to trust is far more reliable than a momentary feeling.\n\n**3. 'Stirrings' often come after believing.**\nMany Christians' experience: they first accepted the gospel's truth rationally and responded in faith; then, after believing, through Bible reading, prayer, and church life, they gradually experienced the reality of God's presence. Act first; feelings follow.\n\n**4. If you're waiting for 'stirrings,' ask yourself: what kind?**\nThunder-and-lightning supernatural experiences? Or deep inner peace? Perhaps God's 'stirring' for you is this very moment of considering these questions — isn't that itself a sign of the Holy Spirit at work?\n\n**5. Delay is itself a choice.**\nNot deciding is a decision — choosing to remain distant from God. 'Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts' (Hebrews 3:7-8).\n\nMartin Luther said: 'Faith is a daring venture — entrusting yourself entirely to a God you cannot see.' Don't wait for perfect feelings to take this step. The locomotive of faith is fact, the coal car is faith itself, and the caboose is feeling — don't let the caboose pull the train.",
