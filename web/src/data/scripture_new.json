    "core_argument_en": "The Old Testament contains hundreds of prophecies about the Messiah that were precisely fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Mathematician Peter Stoner calculated that the probability of just 8 messianic prophecies being simultaneously fulfilled in one person is 1 in 10^17. These prophecies cover every aspect of Christ's life: birthplace (Micah 5:2), manner of birth (Isaiah 7:14), lineage (Genesis 49:10, 2 Samuel 7:12-16), ministry characteristics (Isaiah 61:1-3), manner of suffering (Psalm 22, Isaiah 53), resurrection (Psalm 16:10), and timing (Daniel 9:24-27). These prophecies were written centuries before Jesus Christ, confirmed by archaeological discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls. Such precise fulfillment cannot be coincidence, self-fulfilling prophecy, or later fabrication — they point to God's supernatural foreknowledge and plan. Christianity is not based on blind faith but on historically verifiable facts.",

        "response_en": "This theory cannot withstand archaeological evidence. The Dead Sea Scrolls discovery (1947) included a complete Isaiah manuscript, carbon-14 dated to approximately 125 BC, over 150 years before Jesus' birth. These scrolls contain key messianic prophecies like Isaiah 53 and are virtually identical to existing Masoretic texts. Moreover, the Septuagint (Greek OT) translation from the 3rd-2nd centuries BC, also much earlier than Jesus' time, contains all major messianic prophecies. Archaeological and textual critical evidence consistently demonstrates that these prophecies were indeed written before Jesus Christ."

For example: (1) Birthplace — Jesus' parents lived in Nazareth but were forced to Bethlehem by government census, fulfilling Micah 5:2; (2) Lineage — Jesus' Davidic lineage is recorded in independent genealogies, impossible to fabricate later; (3) Passion details — Psalm 22's crucifixion details (pierced hands and feet, no broken bones, divided garments) were written when crucifixion didn't exist; (4) Others' actions — like Judas's betrayal price (30 silver pieces), Roman soldiers' behavior, etc., were outside Jesus' control.

        "response_en": "While some prophecies do have dual fulfillments or typological meanings (like the Immanuel prophecy), many core messianic prophecies are extremely specific and difficult to interpret otherwise. For example: Daniel 9:24-27 precisely predicts the timing of the Messiah's death; Isaiah 53's suffering servant description matches no historical individual or group in Israel except Jesus Christ perfectly; Psalm 16:10's prophecy about not seeing corruption obviously wasn't fulfilled in David himself (his tomb still exists) but can only point to the Messiah's resurrection. More importantly, Jews in Jesus' time did expect a Messiah, indicating this interpretation already existed and wasn't a later Christian invention."

Archaeologists like William Albright shifted from biblical skepticism to acknowledging its historical reliability.

No archaeological discovery contradicts biblical records. Archaeologist Nelson Glueck said: 'No archaeological discovery has ever controverted a biblical reference.'

First, archaeology can only discover and preserve a small fraction of ancient material evidence — most organic materials and daily items have disappeared. Second, many biblical accounts once thought to 'lack archaeological evidence' were later confirmed, such as the Hittite Empire's existence, the Davidic dynasty's historicity, even Pilate's existence. Third, many events recorded in the Bible (like Israel's 40 years in the wilderness) would inherently be unlikely to leave lasting archaeological traces. Fourth, when archaeology does make discoveries, it consistently supports rather than contradicts biblical records — this pattern itself is persuasive. Most importantly, archaeologists now generally acknowledge that even the most significant ancient events might leave little or no trace in the archaeological record."

First, many discoveries supporting biblical historicity were made by non-Christian or even anti-Christian scholars, like Israel Finkelstein and Baruch Halpern. Second, modern archaeology has strict peer-review procedures and international oversight mechanisms, making systematic evidence concealment or distortion impossible. Third, archaeological evidence itself is objective — pottery shards, inscriptions, architectural remains don't change their nature based on excavators' beliefs. Fourth, many secular university and museum archaeological projects also confirm biblical record accuracy.

Modern scholars understand 'all the earth' differently — possibly referring to Noah's known world. Regarding Exodus: (1) Egyptian official records typically don't record their defeats; (2) Nomadic life in Sinai wouldn't leave substantial archaeological traces; (3) The 2 million figure might be understood differently (Hebrew 'elef could mean family units rather than individuals); (4) Archaeology does find Israel's sudden appearance and settlement pattern changes in Canaan, consistent with biblical records.

They used different languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek), wrote from different geographical locations (from Palestine to Babylon to Rome), and faced different historical circumstances (from wilderness to palace, from peace to persecution). Yet the entire Bible maintains remarkable consistency in theological themes, moral teachings, historical narratives, and prophetic fulfillments.

Fourth, Dead Sea Scrolls discoveries prove the OT text's high consistency over 2000+ years, with no signs of later large-scale modification.

Third, church acceptance: these documents were never widely accepted by mainstream churches but only circulated among specific sects. Fourth, historical reliability: these documents' descriptions of Jesus' life are obviously later legendary elaborations. Their exclusion wasn't subjective choice but based on objective historical and theological standards."

        "response_en": "This misunderstands the historical process. Canon formation's 'lengthy' process actually reflects the early church's caution and responsibility. Most NT books began being quoted and used as Scripture by the late 1st century. By the late 2nd century, core books (four Gospels, Paul's major epistles, Acts, etc.) had gained universal recognition. 'Disputes' focused mainly on a few books, and the disputes' nature was typically 'this book is indeed excellent, but was it really written by an apostle?' rather than 'this book is bad.' This caution precisely shows early church reverence for divine authority. Moreover, canon's actual use and formal confirmation are different things — the church had been using these books in actual worship and teaching for centuries before formal declaration."

The NT possesses over 5,800 Greek manuscripts, 10,000+ Latin manuscripts, plus Syrian, Coptic, and other language translations, totaling over 25,000 copies. By comparison, other classical works have minuscule manuscript counts: Homer's epics ~650, Caesar's Gallic Wars ~250, Plato's works ~200. More importantly, the time gap: the earliest NT manuscript fragment (P52) is only ~40 years from the original, while most classical works' earliest manuscripts are hundreds or thousands of years from originals. The Dead Sea Scrolls discovery (complete Isaiah scroll 1000 years earlier than Masoretic text) proves OT transmission's extreme accuracy — less than 5% difference, all spelling variations affecting no doctrine. Textual critics like F.F. Bruce and Bruce Metzger confirm NT textual reliability exceeds 99.5%. If we doubt biblical textual reliability, we must discard virtually all ancient historical knowledge.",

        "response_en": "This logic is backwards. More manuscripts precisely enable more accurate original text reconstruction. Just as more eyewitnesses in court help determine truth, more manuscripts allow textual critics to discover and correct scribal errors through comparison. The vast majority of variants (over 99%) are obvious scribal slips, spelling differences, or word order changes that don't affect textual meaning. Less than 1% of variants affect translation, and virtually zero affect important doctrine. Moreover, early manuscript consistency (P45, P46, P66, etc.) proves transmission accuracy. Another benefit of numerous manuscripts is wide geographical distribution — manuscripts from different regions reduce systematic error possibilities. Modern computer-assisted textual criticism techniques make original text reconstruction more precise than ever before."

The warning in Revelation 22:18-19 reflects this attitude. Second, if there were systematic theological modifications, we should expect more consistent and 'perfect' texts — but the Bible retains many seemingly 'difficult' passages (Jesus' human weakness, disciples' failures, etc.) that were unhelpful for early church 'image engineering.' Third, different regional manuscript traditions (Alexandrian, Caesarean, Byzantine, etc.) have minor differences but high consistency in core content, indicating no large-scale coordinated modification.

The key is having sufficiently early and numerous copies to reconstruct the original with high accuracy. Textual criticism methods are very mature, able to identify later additions and trace back to the earliest recoverable reading. Early manuscript discoveries (like 20th-century papyrus manuscripts) continuously confirm textual reconstruction accuracy — new discoveries consistently support rather than overturn existing texts. Moreover, 'absolute certainty' is an unreasonable standard — in historical research, we seek high-probability reliability, not mathematical certainty. Based on biblical text transmission evidence quality, we can say our grasp of the original reaches the highest standards of historical research."

Most widely accepted: Matthew records Joseph's (Jesus' legal father) genealogy, Luke records Mary's genealogy.

Another possibility is levirate marriage — if Jacob and Heli were brothers and one died, the other would marry his wife and raise offspring for the deceased, creating differences between legal father (Heli) and biological father (Jacob).

Many scholars believe Genesis 1 uses ancient Near Eastern literary framework, emphasizing theological truth rather than chronological order in modern scientific sense. Creation's 'six days' might be a literary framework (framework interpretation), emphasizing God's creation orderliness and completeness. Moreover, even with literal interpretation, Hebrew 'yom' can denote different time periods. More importantly, Genesis's core message — the universe had a beginning, was created by a rational God, humanity has special status — highly aligns with modern cosmology (Big Bang theory, fine-tuning, anthropic principle).

Moreover, many places once considered 'problems' were later clarified through archaeological discoveries or better historical understanding.
