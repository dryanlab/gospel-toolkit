## CRITICAL Issues

### youth-021 — 三位一体简单解释
**Problem: Modalistic analogies for the Trinity**
The water analogy (ice/liquid/steam = H₂O in different forms) is the classic heresy of **modalism** (Sabellianism) — one substance taking three sequential forms, rather than three co-eternal persons. The sunlight analogy (sun/rays/warmth) tends toward **partialism** — dividing God into parts. While the article notes "these analogies aren't perfect," using known heretical analogies in a youth education context is dangerous. Many people have been taught modalism precisely through the water analogy.

**Fix:** Remove the water analogy entirely. Keep the sunlight analogy with stronger caveats, or replace both with a better explanation emphasizing that no physical analogy perfectly captures the Trinity, and focus on what Scripture reveals.

**Priority: CRITICAL** ✅ Applied

### youth-107 — 赵紫宸 (T.C. Chao)
**Problem: Liberal theologian presented as "faith hero" without qualification**
T.C. Chao was associated with **liberal theology** and the **social gospel movement**. He questioned the virgin birth, bodily resurrection, and other core doctrines. He served as president of the World Council of Churches (known for theological liberalism) and was involved with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Placing him alongside orthodox figures like Augustine, Calvin, Wang Mingdao, and Bonhoeffer as a "faith hero" is deeply misleading for a Reformed/evangelical app. His contribution to Chinese theological contextualization is real, but his theology departed from orthodoxy on critical points.

**Fix:** Either remove this article or substantially rewrite it to honestly present the tensions — acknowledging his contribution to Chinese theological expression while noting his departure from orthodox doctrine. For a Reformed/evangelical youth audience, removal is safer.

**Priority: CRITICAL** ✅ Applied (article rewritten with honest assessment)

### youth-105 — 苏格兰殉道者
**Problem: Factual error — Margaret McLauchlan's age**
The article states Margaret McLauchlan was 13 years old when drowned. Historical records indicate she was approximately **60-63 years old**. It was Margaret Wilson who was 18. The young companion was actually Margaret Wilson herself, not McLauchlan. This is a significant factual error about a well-documented historical event.

**Fix:** Correct McLauchlan's age to approximately 63, and note that the poignancy was the contrast between the elderly woman and the young girl.

**Priority: CRITICAL** ✅ Applied

### youth-106 — 早期教会殉道者
**Problem: Self-contradictory description — "青年殉道者波利卡普86岁"**
The Chinese text calls Polycarp a "青年殉道者" (youth martyr) but then says he was 86 when burned. This is contradictory. Polycarp was not a young martyr — he was one of the oldest.

**Fix:** Remove "青年殉道者" label. Just say "波利卡普".

**Priority: CRITICAL** ✅ Applied

## MEDIUM Issues

### youth-031 — 十诫简明版
**Problem: Ten Commandments numbering confused**
The article lists: (1) only worship true God, (2) don't misuse God's name, (3) keep Sabbath, (4) don't make idols. But the traditional Reformed numbering (following Exodus 20) is: (1) no other gods, (2) no graven images, (3) don't take God's name in vain, (4) keep Sabbath. The article swaps commandments 2 and 4, and 3 and 2.

**Fix:** Reorder to match the standard Reformed/Protestant numbering.

**Priority: MEDIUM** ✅ Applied

---

### youth-073 — 科学家基督徒
**Problem: Misattributed quote**
The article attributes "thinking God's thoughts after Him" to Newton. This quote is actually from **Johannes Kepler** ("I was merely thinking God's thoughts after him"). Newton made similar sentiments but this specific phrasing is Kepler's.

**Fix:** Change attribution to Kepler.

**Priority: MEDIUM** ✅ Applied

### youth-014 — 父母不理解我的信仰
**Problem: Misapplied Bible verse**
Cites **1 Peter 3:1-2** as support for how to deal with parents who don't understand your faith. However, this passage specifically addresses **wives** submitting to unbelieving **husbands**, not children obeying parents. While the principle of "letting actions speak" is transferable, citing this verse in a parent-child context is hermeneutically sloppy.

**Fix:** Replace 1 Peter 3:1-2 with a more appropriate verse like **Colossians 3:20** or **1 Peter 2:12** (general witness through good conduct).

**Priority: MEDIUM** ✅ Applied

---

### youth-077 — DNA设计论证
**Problem: Slight strawman of evolutionary position**
The article says "genetic code是universal...这suggests common designer而非进化假说所主张的independent evolution." Evolutionists don't claim independent evolution of the genetic code — they claim **common descent** (which also explains universality). The argument should be stated more carefully: both common design and common descent can explain the universal code, but the information content points to intelligence.

**Fix:** Reword to avoid strawmanning the evolutionary position while maintaining the design argument.

**Priority: MEDIUM** ✅ Applied

## LOW Issues

### youth-072 — 恐龙与圣经
**Problem: Assumes old-earth timeline without qualification**
States "fossil record shows most dinosaurs went extinct before human history" as if this is settled fact. Young-earth creationists (a significant portion of the Reformed/evangelical audience) would disagree. The article should present this more carefully, noting different perspectives within evangelicalism.

**Fix:** Add qualifier noting this is one interpretation, and that Christians hold different views on the timeline.

**Priority: LOW** (not applied — article already hedges with "we may never know all the details")

---

### youth-104 — 倪柝声
**Problem: Some theological concerns unmentioned**
Watchman Nee's trichotomy (spirit/soul/body taken to extremes) and strict "ground of locality" ecclesiology are considered heterodox by some Reformed theologians. The article focuses on his faithfulness under persecution (appropriate), but calling him "地方教会创始人" in the title without any qualification could implicitly endorse his ecclesiology.

**Priority: LOW** (not applied — the article is balanced enough, focusing on persecution narrative)

---

### youth-099 — 约翰·卫斯理
**Problem: Minor age discrepancy**
Says "34岁才真正经历重生" but Wesley was born June 1703 and the Aldersgate experience was May 1738, making him nearly 35, not 34. Very minor.

**Priority: LOW** (not applied)

---

### youth-106 — 早期教会殉道者 (additional)
**Problem: Agnes's age varies in historical sources**
Article says Agnes was 14; some traditions say 12-13. This is uncertain historical territory.

**Priority: LOW** (not applied — within range of tradition)

## Summary

| Priority | Count | Applied |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Critical | 4 | 4 |
| Medium | 4 | 4 |
| Low | 4 | 0 |
| **Total issues** | **12** | **8** |

**Overall assessment:** The collection is generally solid theologically. The vast majority of articles (96/108) have no significant issues. The critical problems are concentrated in a few articles: the modalistic Trinity analogy, the inclusion of a liberal theologian as "faith hero," and two factual errors in the historical articles. The science & faith section is well done, correctly treating macro-evolution as hypothesis rather than fact. Reformed soteriology is consistently presented. Scripture citations are generally appropriate and relevant.
