    "content_zh": "福音就是「好消息」——这是整个宇宙最美好的消息！想象一下，如果你犯了一个巨大的错误，需要付出你永远无法承担的代价，突然有人站出来说「我替你付」，你会是什么感觉？这就是福音的核心。\n\n我们的问题：罪的现实\n简单来说，上帝按着祂的形象创造了我们，本意是让我们与祂有完美的关系，享受祂的爱。但我们都选择了背叛——这就是「罪」。不只是做坏事，更是我们内心想要「做自己的上帝」的叛逆态度。就像一台精密的电脑，如果核心程序出错，整个系统都会崩溃。罪让我们与创造主分离，导致死亡和永远的孤独。\n\n上帝的解决方案：十字架的爱\n但故事还没结束！上帝太爱我们了，祂不愿意看着我们永远沉沦。所以祂做了一件不可思议的事——差遣自己的独生子耶稣来到这个破碎的世界。耶稣不是来当一个好老师或道德榜样，而是来当我们的救主。祂在十字架上承担了我们所有的罪和刑罚，三天后从死里复活，证明死亡已经被彻底击败！\n\n我们的回应：信心的礼物\n那么，我们需要做什么呢？答案让很多人惊讶：不需要做什么来「赚取」这份救恩！我们只需要相信——承认自己确实需要拯救，相信耶稣已经为我们完成了一切，接受祂作为我们生命的主。就像溺水的人抓住救生圈，不是因为自己游泳技术好，而是因为知道那是唯一的希望。\n\n生命的转变：新的开始\n当你真心接受这个好消息时，几件奇妙的事会发生：你成为上帝的儿女，罪得到完全赦免，获得永恒的生命，圣灵住进你心里开始改变你。这不是说你突然变得完美，而是说你有了新的身份和新的力量来过不同的生活。\n\n福音跟「做个好人上天堂」完全不同。如果救恩靠行为，那就像考试必须100分才及格——没人做得到！但福音说：耶稣已经替你考了满分，现在把成绩单给你。你要做的只是伸手接过来。这就是恩典——不配得的爱和礼物。这个好消息改变了亿万人的生命，今天也能改变你的！",
    "content_en": "The Gospel means 'good news' — the best news in the entire universe! Imagine if you made a huge mistake requiring a price you could never pay, and someone stepped forward saying 'I'll pay it for you.' How would you feel? That's the heart of the Gospel.\n\nOur Problem: The Reality of Sin\nSimply put, God created us in His image, intending perfect relationship with Him and enjoyment of His love. But we all chose rebellion — that's 'sin.' Not just doing bad things, but the rebellious attitude of wanting to 'be our own god.' Like a precision computer with corrupted core programming, the whole system crashes. Sin separates us from our Creator, leading to death and eternal loneliness.\n\nGod's Solution: The Love of the Cross\nBut the story isn't over! God loves us too much to watch us perish forever. So He did something incredible — sent His only Son Jesus into this broken world. Jesus didn't come as a good teacher or moral example, but as our Savior. On the cross, He bore all our sin and punishment, then rose from the dead three days later, proving death was completely defeated!\n\nOur Response: The Gift of Faith\nSo what must we do? The answer surprises many: nothing to 'earn' this salvation! We only need to believe — admit we truly need rescue, believe Jesus already accomplished everything for us, accept Him as our life's Lord. Like a drowning person grabbing a life ring, not because of swimming skills but knowing it's the only hope.\n\nLife Transformation: A New Beginning\nWhen you truly accept this good news, amazing things happen: you become God's child, sins are completely forgiven, you receive eternal life, and the Holy Spirit moves in to begin changing you. This doesn't mean sudden perfection, but a new identity and new power to live differently.\n\nThe Gospel is completely different from 'being good enough for heaven.' If salvation depended on works, it would be like needing 100% to pass an exam — nobody could do it! But the Gospel says: Jesus already scored perfect for you and hands you the report card. You just need to reach out and take it. This is grace — undeserved love and gift. This good news has transformed billions of lives and can transform yours today!",

    "content_en": "Prayer is just talking to God — like chatting with your closest friend. You don't need fancy words or a special posture. You can pray anytime, anywhere — on the way to school, before a test, when you're happy, when you're sad.\n\nHow to start? Find a quiet place and time. No special location needed, but avoiding distractions helps. Start with a simple acknowledgment: \"God, I want to talk to You.\" No fancy words needed — excitement, worry, gratitude, confusion — bring it all. God already knows your heart; He just wants to hear your genuine voice.\n\nThe ACTS method: A simple framework: A-Adoration (praise God for who He is), C-Confession (honestly admit what you've done wrong), T-Thanksgiving (thank God for His blessings), S-Supplication (tell Him what you need).\n\nPrayer is also listening. Prayer isn't just talking — it's also waiting quietly. After praying, spend time in silence and let God's Spirit speak to your heart.\n\nDon't worry about format. Pray out loud or silently, long or short — it all counts. Five minutes of sincere prayer beats half an hour of empty words. Remember, prayer isn't casting a spell, and God isn't a vending machine. He's your heavenly Father who cares about your heart, not your vocabulary. Sometimes God's answer is 'yes,' sometimes 'not yet,' and sometimes 'I have a better plan' — but He always responds.",

The Bible is God speaking to us — through it, you'll grow to understand His character, His love, and His plan.\n\n2) To know yourself. The Bible is like a mirror, helping you see clearly — your worth, your struggles, your purpose. \"The word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.\" (Hebrews 4:12)\n\n3) A guide for life. When facing choices, confusion, or pressure, the Bible gives you wisdom and direction. \"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.\" (Psalm 119:105)\n\n4) Spiritual nourishment. Just as your body needs food, your soul needs God's Word to grow. A Christian who doesn't read the Bible is like a person who doesn't eat — they'll grow weaker.\n\n5) Resisting temptation. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, He used Scripture to fight back. You need this weapon too.\n\n6) Experiencing God's presence.

For example, science can tell you water is H₂O, but it can't tell you the meaning of life. The fine-tuning of the universe and the stability of natural laws actually point to an intelligent Creator. It's important to note that macro-evolution remains only a hypothesis, facing many scientific challenges (such as the Cambrian Explosion, the origin of biological information, etc.) — it has NOT been 'proven.' Micro-evolution (adaptive changes within species) is observable, but macro-evolution from single cells to humans has never been directly observed. The Big Bang theory actually points to the universe having a beginning — which is consistent with the Bible's 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.'

    "content_en": "The Bible says, 'One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother' (Proverbs 18:24). Friends have huge influence, especially during teenage years. Good friends help you grow and don't pull you away from God.\n\nHow to find good friends?\n\n1) BE a good friend first. Care for others, listen, be genuine.\n\n2) Distinguish close friends from casual friends. Close friends should support your faith growth — even if not Christians, they should at least respect your faith. Casual friends can include various people, and that's an evangelism opportunity too.\n\n3) Join a church youth group. You'll find peers who share your faith. Spiritual friendships help you grow.\n\n4) Don't be afraid to befriend non-Christians. Jesus ate with 'sinners' too. The key is that you influence them, not the other way around. Participate in healthy activities, avoid tempting situations.\n\n5) Learn to set boundaries. If a friendship keeps pushing you to do things against your conscience, have the courage to say no. Don't compromise principles to be popular — real friends accept the real you.\n\n6) Remember you're also influencing others. Ask yourself: am I helping friends move closer to or further from God?\n\nMost importantly: Jesus is your best friend. When you're lonely, He will never leave you. Good friendships take time — don't rush it.",

    "content_en": "Social media is a tool — it's not bad in itself, but it can be used well or poorly. As a Christian, how do you use it wisely?\n\n1) Comparison is the thief of joy. When you see others' 'perfect lives,' remember those are curated highlights. Your worth is already fully established before God — no comparison needed.\n\n2) Manage your time. Social media is addictive, stealing time from God and real relationships. If you spend way more time on your phone than with God, it's time to adjust. Set boundaries, regularly 'fast' from social media.\n\n3) Be careful what you consume. Inappropriate content quietly shapes your thinking. 'Guard your heart' (Proverbs 4:23). Before posting, ask yourself: will this help people know Christ better? Avoid complaining, showing off, spreading rumors. 'Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only what builds others up.'\n\n4) Use it positively. Share encouraging verses, grace testimonies, meaningful content. Social media is also a new platform for witness.\n\n5) Avoid online arguments. Especially about politics or controversial topics — private conversations are more effective than public debates.\n\n6) Offline relationships matter more. No amount of likes beats a real hug. Regularly put down your phone and be with real people.\n\nRemember: the internet leaves permanent traces — what you post today might be seen ten years from now.",

But remember: fear doesn't come from God, and you have the best news — eternal life, forgiveness, hope!\n\nTruths to overcome fear:\nYou don't need to be a theologian. The most powerful testimony is YOUR story.\nThe outcome isn't your responsibility — you plant seeds; the Spirit makes them grow.\nRejecting the Gospel isn't rejecting you — they're rejecting Jesus, not you personally.\n\nHow to share your testimony:\nA good testimony has three parts: before Christ (your life, struggles), meeting Christ (how you encountered Him, what moved you), after Christ (how life has changed). Even if you grew up in a Christian family, your testimony can be about faith becoming 'my own' rather than 'my parents'.' Stay authentic, don't exaggerate; focus on what Christ did; practice telling it in 2-3 minutes.\n\nPractical tips:\n1) Build relationships first — people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.\n2) Share naturally — don't force it. Bring it up in conversation. Use language your audience understands, avoid church jargon.\n3) Learn to listen — understand what the other person thinks and needs, then connect the Gospel to that.\n4) Always be ready — 'Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have' (1 Peter 3:15).\n5) Start small — invite friends to church events, mention prayer during tough times.\n6) Rely on the Spirit — changing hearts is God's job, not yours. Ask for opportunities, words, and courage.\n\nThe biggest secret of evangelism: genuine love. When people feel you truly care, they're more willing to listen. What if you fail? The world won't end.

    "content_en": "The Trinity sounds complicated, but it's actually one of Christianity's most beautiful truths. God is one God, but He exists simultaneously as three persons: Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit. Not three gods, nor one God playing three roles, but one divine nature in three persons existing at the same time — a profound mystery.\n\nThink of sunlight: the sun itself, the light rays, the warmth — inseparable yet distinguishable. Though all analogies are imperfect, because the Trinity transcends our everyday experience. One common but misleading analogy is water's three states (ice, liquid, steam) — this actually teaches the heresy of modalism, since water can only be in one state at a time, while the three persons of the Trinity exist simultaneously.\n\nWhat are their roles? The Father is the Creator and Planner, Jesus the Son is the Redeemer and Way, the Holy Spirit is the Comforter and Guide. They're equally important, same essence, but different functions. The Father created us, the Son saved us, the Spirit lives in us.\n\nWhen you pray, you pray to the Father, in Jesus' name, with the Spirit's help — all three persons are involved in your relationship with God.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because it tells us that God's very essence is relationship and love. Within the Trinity, there's perfect loving communion, and we're invited into this loving relationship too. God understands relationships and community because He IS perfect relationship. Knowing the Trinity isn't just theology — it's knowing what kind of God deeply loves you.",

It's like a test where you need 100% to pass, and we get 98% at most — still not enough. But Jesus got perfect scores and gave us His report card! So we do good things not to earn salvation, but because we're already saved, out of gratitude.

The Holy Spirit came at Pentecost, empowering disciples to witness for Jesus. Peter preached, 3000 believed, and the church was born. Early church characteristics: devoted to apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking bread, prayer. Stephen became the first martyr, Saul (later Paul) persecuted the church. But persecution actually spread the Gospel further. Paul's three missionary journeys established many churches, taking the Gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. Key themes: Holy Spirit's power, bold witnessing, church growth, Gospel's universality. This book shows us how early Christians lived, faced persecution, and evangelized. Today we need the same Holy Spirit filling and evangelistic heart.",

Second, the macro-evolutionary hypothesis faces serious scientific challenges: in the Cambrian Explosion nearly all animal phyla appeared suddenly without gradual transitional fossils; irreducible complexity shows many biological systems cannot form through gradual evolution; the genetic information in DNA is extraordinarily complex, and natural processes have never been observed producing this level of functional information. Third, micro-evolution (adaptive changes within species, like finch beak changes and bacterial resistance) is observable fact, but this is a completely different level from fish-to-human macro-evolution. Fourth, while many scientists accept the evolutionary hypothesis, science isn't a vote — many widely-accepted theories were later overturned.

First, natural laws are descriptions, not prescriptions. They describe how God normally operates, not limits on what He can do — like authors having the right to change story rules. Second, miracles don't break laws but involve higher power's intervention. When you lift a ball, you don't 'violate' gravity but apply greater force. Third, if God exists and created natural laws, He certainly can supersede them for specific purposes. Fourth, miracles' purpose isn't showing off but revealing God's character and advancing His plan. Jesus' miracles all had compassionate purpose. Fifth, science can study natural regularities but can't rule out supernatural intervention — that would be methodological overreach. Sixth, historical evidence for miracles (especially Resurrection) should be evaluated on historical grounds, not a priori dismissed because of scientific worldview.",

Benefits: escape distractions, hear God's voice more clearly, process emotions, gain perspective, recharge spiritually. How to practice: find quiet location, turn off devices, start with short periods (maybe 10-15 minutes), gradually increase. What to do: sit quietly, read small Bible passage slowly, pray conversationally, listen for God's voice, simply enjoy God's presence. Might feel uncomfortable initially — we're so used to noise. That's normal. Thoughts will wander, gently bring focus back to God. Don't need profound experience each time, just being available to God is important. Best times: early morning before day gets busy, evening when things quiet down, during lunch break if possible. Regular solitude helps develop ability to hear God's voice, increases peace, strengthens relationship with God.",

How to pray during difficulties: be completely honest with God about your feelings, don't pretend everything's okay. God can handle your anger, fear, confusion. Use Psalms as model — David expressed every emotion. Ask specific questions: 'God, where are You?' 'Why is this happening?' 'How long must I wait?' Remember God's character: He's loving, faithful, present even when feels distant. Pray for strength to endure, wisdom to respond well, eyes to see His work even in pain.

He originally wanted to go to China as a missionary, but due to the Opium War he went to Africa instead. Livingstone didn't just preach the Gospel - he was also a doctor and geographer, working to eliminate the slave trade. He spent 30 years deep in inland Africa, discovered Victoria Falls, mapped Africa, and paved the way for future missionaries. Despite facing disease, tribal conflicts, and the pain of his wife's death, Livingstone never gave up. He said: 'I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward.' In 1873, he died while praying in a small African hut; his heart was buried in Africa while his body was taken back to England. The Africans said: 'His heart remains with us.' Livingstone proves: true missionaries don't just preach, they love the local people and give everything for their welfare!",

Deeply influenced by liberal theology, he questioned or denied core doctrines including biblical authority, Christ's deity, the virgin birth, and bodily resurrection. He was involved with the World Council of Churches (WCC), known for theological liberalism, and later participated in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.\n\nChao's story gives us an important warning: contextualization (rooting the Gospel in local culture) is necessary, but never at the cost of core doctrine. The Gospel does need to be expressed in culturally accessible ways, but its content — Christ's deity, the atoning cross, bodily resurrection — cannot be reduced or redefined.

The Great Commission has three actions: go, baptize, teach. 'Go' means we can't just sit in church waiting — we must actively reach out. 'Baptize' means bringing people into the faith community. 'Teach' means conversion is just the beginning; ongoing discipleship is essential. The most reassuring part is Jesus' promise: 'I am with you always.' You're not doing this alone — the Almighty walks with you.",

Second, try different ministries — where do you feel joy and see fruit? Third, listen to feedback — others often see your gifts more clearly than you do.

The simplest method is 'Observe-Interpret-Apply': Step 1, Observe: What does the text say? Who? What? Where? When? How? Step 2, Interpret: What does it mean? Why did the author write this? What did it mean in its original context? Step 3, Apply: What does this passage mean for my life today? What do I need to change? Tips for leading: ask open-ended questions (not yes/no), give people time to think, don't rush to give answers, encourage everyone to participate, and keep pointing back to the text. Remember, you don't need to know all the answers — your role is guiding everyone to seek together.",

First, you need teaching — pastors and elders help you understand Scripture correctly. Second, you need community — supporting, accountable to, and encouraging one another in love.
