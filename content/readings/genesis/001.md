### 摩西的话

弟兄姐妹，我要从"起初"说起。

当我在西奈山下写这些话的时候，以色列人刚从埃及出来不久。四百年了——四百年在埃及为奴的日子。他们天天看埃及人拜太阳神拉，拜尼罗河神哈皮，拜法老。很多人心里已经分不清谁才是真神了。

所以耶和华对我说：**你要从头告诉他们。**

"起初，神创造天地。"

就这一句话，把埃及所有的假神都拆毁了。太阳不是神——第四天才被造出来的。尼罗河不是神——第三天水才被聚到一处。法老不是神——人是第六天按神的形象造的，法老也不过是被造之物。

你们注意"起初"这两个字。不是"很久很久以前"，不是"也许有一天"——是**起初**。斩钉截铁。在一切之先，神已经在那里了。不是混沌在先，不是黑暗在先，是神在先。

然后你看神怎么创造的——**神说**。他不需要争战，不需要从什么巨人的尸体上切割出天地来。埃及人的创世神话充满了打斗和血腥，但我们的神，他只需要开口说话。"神说要有光，就有了光。"权柄何等大，何等轻省。

六天的创造有一个精妙的结构，你们看：

- 第1日 造**光** ↔ 第4日 造**光体**（太阳月亮星辰）
- 第2日 分**天与水** ↔ 第5日 造**飞鸟与鱼**
- 第3日 现**旱地与植物** ↔ 第6日 造**动物与人**

前三天造"空间"，后三天填满"居民"。这不是随意的，这是一位有秩序的神在做工。

最后，到了第六天，神说了一句不同的话。前面都是"神说，要有……就有了"。但造人的时候，神说：**"我们要照着我们的形象，按着我们的样式造人。"**

"我们"——我写下这个词的时候，还不完全明白。但如今你们知道了，这是圣父、圣子、圣灵，三位一体的神在彼此商议。造山造海造星辰，神吩咐就成了；唯独造人，神停下来说"我们"。**你在神眼中何等尊贵，你知道吗？**

每造完一样，神都看着说"好的"。造完一切之后，神看着说"甚好"。不是"还行"，不是"凑合"——是**甚好**。这个世界从神手中出来的时候，没有死亡，没有眼泪，没有罪。一切都是甚好的。

你读完第一章，记住一件事：在一切之先，神已经在那里了。他说有就有，命立就立。这位创造天地的神，也是呼召你的神。

### Moses' Words

Brothers and sisters, I must begin at "the beginning."

When I wrote these words at the foot of Mount Sinai, the Israelites had just come out of Egypt. Four hundred years — four hundred years of slavery. Every day they watched the Egyptians worship Ra the sun god, Hapi the river god, and Pharaoh himself. Many of them could no longer tell who the true God was.

So the LORD said to me: **Tell them from the very beginning.**

"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

That one sentence demolished every false god in Egypt. The sun is not God — it was not created until the fourth day. The Nile is not God — the waters were not gathered until the third day. Pharaoh is not God — man was made on the sixth day in God's image, and Pharaoh is merely a creature like any other.

Notice the words "in the beginning." Not "once upon a time." Not "perhaps one day." It is **in the beginning** — definitive, absolute. Before all things, God was already there. Not chaos first, not darkness first — God first.

Then see how God creates — **God said**. He does not need to battle. He does not carve the world from the corpse of some slain giant, as the Egyptian myths tell. Our God simply speaks. "God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light." What authority. What effortless sovereignty.

The six days of creation reveal an exquisite structure:

- Day 1: **Light** ↔ Day 4: **Luminaries** (sun, moon, stars)
- Day 2: **Sky and waters** ↔ Day 5: **Birds and fish**
- Day 3: **Land and vegetation** ↔ Day 6: **Animals and man**

The first three days form the "spaces"; the last three days fill them with "inhabitants." This is not random — this is a God of order at work.

Finally, on the sixth day, God said something different. Before, it was always "Let there be... and there was." But when creating man, God said: **"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."**

"Let us" — when I wrote those words, I did not fully understand them. But now you know: this is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit — the triune God in divine counsel. Mountains, seas, and stars were commanded into existence; but for man alone, God paused and said "let us." **Do you know how precious you are in God's sight?**

After each act of creation, God looked and said "it was good." After completing everything, God looked and said "it was **very good**." Not "acceptable." Not "adequate." **Very good.** When this world came from God's hand, there was no death, no tears, no sin. Everything was very good.

When you finish this first chapter, remember one thing: before all things, God was already there. He speaks and it is done; He commands and it stands firm. This God who created the heavens and the earth is the same God who calls you.

**📖 经文 Scripture:** 创世记 Genesis 1:1-31

**🔍 导读要点 Key Points:**

**📍 历史背景 Historical Context**
摩西约在公元前1446年带领以色列人出埃及后，在西奈旷野写下创世记。当时的以色列人深受埃及多神论影响，需要从根本上认识独一真神。
Moses wrote Genesis in the Sinai wilderness around 1446 BC, after leading Israel out of Egypt. The Israelites were deeply influenced by Egyptian polytheism and needed to know the one true God from the very foundation.

**🔍 经文结构 Structure**
六日创造呈对称结构（forming → filling），第七日安息为高潮。"神说"出现十次，对应十诫的十句话。
The six days of creation follow a symmetrical structure (forming → filling), with the seventh day of rest as the climax. "God said" appears ten times, echoing the Ten Commandments.

**⛪ 神学意涵 Theological Significance**
• 神是独一的创造者（反对多神论）
• 创造出于神的话语，不是争战（反对异教神话）
• 人按神的形象被造，有独特尊严（反对人是神的奴隶）
• 物质世界是"甚好"的（反对诺斯替主义）

**✝️ 基督的影子 Shadow of Christ**
"太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。万物是借着他造的。"（约1:1-3）约翰用了和创世记一模一样的开头，告诉我们：那位说"要有光"的神，就是道成肉身的基督。
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through him." (John 1:1-3) John deliberately echoes Genesis, telling us: the God who said "Let there be light" is the same Christ who became flesh.
