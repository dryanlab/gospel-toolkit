### 摩西的话

弟兄姐妹，这是整本圣经最沉重的一章。

我每次写到这里，手都在发抖。因为从这一章开始，一切都碎了。

"耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田野一切的活物更狡猾。"

注意——蛇是"耶和华神所造的"。它不是什么独立的邪恶力量，不是跟神平起平坐的对手。它是被造之物。但它被那古蛇——魔鬼——附了。牠来到女人面前，没有直接说"去吃那果子"。不，牠比那狡猾得多。

牠问了一个问题：**"神岂是真说不许你们吃园中所有树上的果子吗？"**

你们看到了吗？牠做了三件事。第一，**歪曲神的话**——神明明说"各样树上的果子你可以随意吃"，蛇把它扭成了"不许你们吃所有的果子"，把一位慷慨的神变成了一个吝啬的暴君。第二，**用问句而不是陈述句**——牠不告诉你该怎么想，牠让你自己开始怀疑。第三，**牠不叫神的名字**——"神岂是真说"，不是"耶和华岂是真说"。牠把那位和你立约的、爱你的神，变成了一个遥远的、可疑的概念。

**这就是试探的本质：不是叫你做坏事，是叫你怀疑神的好。**

夏娃回答的时候，也出了问题。她说："惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说你们不可吃，**也不可摸**，免得你们死。"

神从来没有说"不可摸"。夏娃自己加上去的。她把神的命令变得比实际更苛刻——当你觉得神不合理的时候，你就离悖逆不远了。

然后蛇说了那句致命的话：**"你们不一定死。因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。"**

"你们便如神。"——这是一切罪的根源。不是偷窃，不是谋杀，不是淫乱。是**想要成为神**。想要自己定义善恶，自己做主，不再需要那位创造你的神。第一章里神说"我们要照着我们的形象造人"，到了第三章，人说"我要成为神"。从像神到想当神——一字之差，天壤之别。

**"于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了，又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。"**

亚当在哪里？就在旁边。"她又给她丈夫，**她丈夫也吃了**。"他什么都没说。神让他看守这园子，保护这女人——他一言不发地站在那里，看着蛇欺骗他的妻子，然后接过果子就吃了。

亚当的沉默，和夏娃被骗一样严重。

**"他们二人的眼睛就明亮了，才知道自己是赤身露体，便拿无花果树的叶子为自己编做裙子。"**

上一章最后一句是什么？"赤身露体，并不羞耻。"现在呢？**羞耻来了。** 他们的身体没有变，变的是他们的心。罪进来之后，第一个反应不是疼痛，不是恐惧——是**羞耻**。他们开始遮盖自己。

然后他们听到神的声音——"天起了凉风，耶和华神在园中行走。"

以前，这是他们一天中最盼望的时刻。现在，他们藏了起来。

神呼唤那人，说：**"你在哪里？"**

这是圣经里最心碎的一个问题。神当然知道他们在哪里。这不是质问，这是一位父亲在找他走丢的孩子。**"你在哪里？"** 不是要定位，是要你回来。

亚当说："我听见你的声音，我就害怕。因为我赤身露体，我便藏了。"

然后互相推卸：亚当怪夏娃——"**你所赐给我**与我同居的女人"——你们听到了吗？他甚至在怪神。夏娃怪蛇："蛇引诱我，我就吃了。"

**罪的第二个特征：不肯承认。**

但接下来，是整本圣经最重要的一节经文之一。神对蛇说：

**"我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇；你的后裔和女人的后裔也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头，你要伤他的脚跟。"**

弟兄姐妹，我写下这句话的时候，还不知道"女人的后裔"是谁。但如今你们知道了——**那就是耶稣基督。** 他在十字架上被蛇"伤了脚跟"——他受苦、流血、死了。但他"伤了蛇的头"——他从死里复活，彻底击碎了罪和死亡的权势。

在人犯罪的同一天，在审判的话语中间，神已经藏下了救赎的应许。**这就是恩典——你还在逃跑，他已经在追你了。**

然后神做了一件事："耶和华神为亚当和他妻子用**皮子**做衣服给他们穿。"

人自己用无花果树叶子遮盖——不够。神用皮子——这意味着有一只动物为他们死了。有血流出来了。**这是圣经里第一次献祭的影子。** 人的罪，需要代价。那只无名的动物，指向两千年后各各他山上那只"神的羔羊"。

最后，神把他们赶出了伊甸园，在园子东边安设基路伯和四面转动发火焰的剑，"要把守生命树的道路"。

回不去了。伊甸的门关上了。

但请你们记住——神没有说"永远关上了"。那条通往生命树的路，终有一天会重新打开。在圣经的最后一卷，约翰看见了："在河这边与那边有生命树，结十二样果子。"（启22:2）

从伊甸到新耶路撒冷，从被赶出去到被迎回来——**这就是整本圣经的故事。**

### Moses' Words

Brothers and sisters, this is the heaviest chapter in all of Scripture.

Every time I come to write it, my hand trembles. Because from this chapter onward, everything shatters.

"Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made."

Notice — the serpent is one "the LORD God had made." It is not some independent force of evil, not an adversary equal to God. It is a creature. But it was possessed by that ancient serpent — the devil. It came to the woman, and it did not say directly, "Go eat the fruit." No, it was far more cunning than that.

It asked a question: **"Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"**

Do you see what it did? Three things. First, **it distorted God's word** — God clearly said "you are free to eat from any tree," but the serpent twisted it into "you must not eat from any tree," turning a generous God into a stingy tyrant. Second, **it used a question, not a statement** — it does not tell you what to think; it makes you begin to doubt on your own. Third, **it did not use God's name** — "Did God really say," not "Did the LORD really say." It turned the covenant God who loves you into a distant, suspicious concept.

**This is the essence of temptation: not to make you do evil, but to make you doubt God's goodness.**

Eve's reply was also flawed. She said: "God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and **you must not touch it**, or you will die.'"

God never said "you must not touch it." Eve added that herself. She made God's command harsher than it actually was — and when you begin to see God as unreasonable, you are not far from rebellion.

Then the serpent spoke its lethal words: **"You will not certainly die. For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."**

"You will be like God." This is the root of all sin. Not theft, not murder, not adultery. It is **wanting to be God.** Wanting to define good and evil for yourself, to be your own master, to no longer need the God who made you. In chapter one, God said "Let us make man in our image." In chapter three, man says "I will be like God." From being like God to wanting to be God — a subtle shift, an infinite chasm.

**"When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it."**

Where was Adam? Right there. "She also gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it." He said nothing. God had charged him to tend and guard the garden, to protect this woman — and he stood there in silence, watching the serpent deceive his wife, then took the fruit and ate.

Adam's silence was as grave as Eve's deception.

**"Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves."**

What was the last verse of the previous chapter? "They were naked, and they felt no shame." And now? **Shame arrived.** Their bodies had not changed; their hearts had. When sin entered, the first response was not pain, not fear — it was **shame**. They began to cover themselves.

Then they heard the sound of God — "the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day."

Once, this was the moment they longed for most each day. Now, they hid.

God called out to the man: **"Where are you?"**

This is the most heartbreaking question in all of Scripture. God certainly knew where they were. This was not an interrogation — this was a Father searching for his lost child. **"Where are you?"** Not to locate, but to call you home.

Adam said: "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."

Then came the blame-shifting: Adam blamed Eve — "**The woman you put here with me** — she gave me some fruit" — did you hear that? He was even blaming God. Eve blamed the serpent: "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

**The second mark of sin: the refusal to own it.**

But then comes one of the most important verses in all of Scripture. God said to the serpent:

**"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."**

Brothers and sisters, when I wrote these words, I did not yet know who "her offspring" would be. But now you know — **it is Jesus Christ.** On the cross, the serpent "struck his heel" — he suffered, bled, and died. But he "crushed the serpent's head" — he rose from the dead and utterly destroyed the power of sin and death.

On the very day man sinned, embedded within the words of judgment, God had already hidden the promise of redemption. **This is grace — while you were still running away, he was already pursuing you.**

Then God did something: "The LORD God made garments of **skin** for Adam and his wife and clothed them."

The fig leaves man made for himself were not enough. God used animal skins — which means an animal died for them. Blood was shed. **This is the first shadow of sacrifice in Scripture.** Human sin requires a cost. That unnamed animal points forward to "the Lamb of God" on Golgotha two thousand years later.

Finally, God drove them out of the Garden of Eden, and at the east of the garden he placed cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to "guard the way to the tree of life."

There was no going back. The gate of Eden was shut.

But remember — God never said it was shut forever. That path to the tree of life will one day reopen. In the last book of Scripture, John saw it: "On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit." (Rev 22:2)

From Eden to the New Jerusalem, from exile to homecoming — **this is the story of the entire Bible.**
