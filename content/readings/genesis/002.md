### 摩西的话

弟兄姐妹，第一章我给你们看了全景——六天创造的壮丽图画。现在我要把镜头拉近，让你们看看第六天到底发生了什么。

先说安息日。"到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工，安息了。"

你们不要误解——神不是累了。造天地对他来说毫不费力。他安息，是因为一切都**完成了**。这个安息是满足的安息，是一位艺术家看着自己完美的作品、放下画笔的安息。他定这一日为圣日，是给你们的——让你们知道，人活着不是只为了劳碌，你是被造来享受神的同在的。

现在让我告诉你们，神是怎么造人的。

他没有说"要有人"就有了人。不是的。**"耶和华神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人。"**

你听到了吗？尘土。你是从尘土来的。别以为自己多了不起——你的身体和脚下的泥土是同一种材料。但也别以为自己多卑微——因为那位创造宇宙的神，弯下腰来，亲手揉捏你，然后把脸凑近你，把他自己的气息吹进你的鼻孔。

**这不是工厂流水线，这是一位父亲在塑造他的孩子。**

然后耶和华在东方的伊甸立了一个园子，把人安置在里面。那个园子什么样？各样的树从地里长出来，可以悦人的眼目，其上的果子好作食物。还有一条河从伊甸流出来，滋润那园子。神把人放在丰盛里面，不是放在荒漠里面。

但园子中间有两棵特别的树：生命树，和分别善恶树。

耶和华吩咐那人说：**"园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃，只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死。"**

你们想一想这个画面。整座园子的果子都是你的——随意吃。只有一棵树不可以。这不是苛刻，这是恩典中的界限。神是在说：我把一切都给你了，但你要记住一件事——**我是神，你不是。** 善恶的标准是我定的，不是你定的。这棵树不是试探，是提醒。

接着，神说了一句非常深的话：**"那人独居不好。"**

在一切都"甚好"的创造中，这是神第一次说"不好"。不是因为亚当有什么缺陷，而是因为神造人是为了关系——和神的关系，和人的关系。独居不好，因为人不是被设计来孤独的。

然后神让亚当给动物起名。一个一个来——牛、羊、鹰、鱼……但"那人没有遇见配偶帮助他"。神让亚当自己发现：动物不能填满心里那个位置。

**"耶和华神使他沉睡，他就睡了；于是取下他的一根肋骨，又把肉合起来。耶和华神就用那人身上所取的肋骨造成一个女人，领她到那人跟前。"**

不是从头取的——免得她辖管他。不是从脚取的——免得他践踏她。是从**肋旁**取的——在他心脏旁边，要他珍惜她、保护她。

亚当看见夏娃的时候，说了人类历史上第一句话：**"这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉。"** 这不是冷静的分类学报告——这是一个人终于遇见了另一个人时，心底涌出来的惊叹。

"因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。"——婚姻不是人发明的制度，是神在伊甸园亲手设立的。

最后一节："当时夫妻二人赤身露体，并不羞耻。"

记住这句话。因为到了第三章，一切都变了。

### Moses' Words

Brothers and sisters, in the first chapter I showed you the panorama — the magnificent canvas of six days of creation. Now I want to bring the lens closer, to show you what actually happened on the sixth day.

First, the Sabbath. "By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work."

Do not misunderstand — God was not tired. Creating the heavens and the earth cost him no effort. He rested because everything was **complete.** This is the rest of satisfaction, like an artist setting down his brush before a perfect masterpiece. He made this day holy as a gift to you — so you would know that you were not made merely for toil. You were made to enjoy the presence of God.

Now let me tell you how God made man.

He did not simply say "Let there be man" and man appeared. No. **"The LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being."**

Did you hear that? Dust. You came from dust. Do not think too highly of yourself — your body is made of the same material as the dirt beneath your feet. But do not think too little of yourself either — because the God who created the universe bent down, shaped you with his own hands, then brought his face close to yours and breathed his own breath into you.

**This was not an assembly line. This was a Father forming his child.**

Then the LORD planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and placed the man there. What was that garden like? Every tree that was pleasant to the sight and good for food grew from the ground. A river flowed from Eden to water the garden. God placed man in abundance, not in a wasteland.

But in the middle of the garden stood two remarkable trees: the tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

The LORD commanded the man: **"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will certainly die."**

Consider this picture. Every fruit in the entire garden is yours — eat freely. Only one tree is forbidden. This is not harsh — this is a boundary within grace. God is saying: I have given you everything, but remember one thing — **I am God, and you are not.** The standard of good and evil is mine to set, not yours. This tree is not a trap; it is a reminder.

Then God said something profoundly moving: **"It is not good for the man to be alone."**

In a creation where everything was "very good," this is the first time God says "not good." Not because Adam was defective, but because God made man for relationship — with God and with others. It is not good to be alone, because man was not designed for solitude.

So God had Adam name the animals. One by one — cattle, sheep, eagles, fish... but "for Adam no suitable helper was found." God let Adam discover for himself: animals cannot fill that place in the heart.

**"So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man."**

Not from his head — lest she rule over him. Not from his foot — lest he trample her. From his **side** — near his heart, so he would cherish and protect her.

When Adam saw Eve, he spoke the first human words in history: **"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."** This was not a calm taxonomic report — this was the wonder that burst from a man who had finally found another like himself.

"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh." Marriage is not a human invention. It is an institution God himself established in Eden.

The final verse: "Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."

Remember those words. Because in the next chapter, everything changes.

**📖 经文 Scripture:** 创世记 Genesis 2:1-25

**🔍 导读要点 Key Points:**

**📍 历史背景 Historical Context**
创世记第2章不是与第1章矛盾的"另一个创造故事"，而是对第六天的详细特写。古近东文学常用这种"概述+聚焦"的手法。
Genesis 2 is not a contradictory "second creation account" but a detailed close-up of the sixth day. This "overview then zoom-in" technique is common in ancient Near Eastern literature.

**🔍 经文结构 Structure**
2:1-3 安息日 → 2:4-17 造人与伊甸 → 2:18-25 造女人与婚姻。从宇宙视角收窄到园子，再收窄到两个人的关系。
2:1-3 Sabbath → 2:4-17 Man and Eden → 2:18-25 Woman and marriage. The lens narrows from cosmos to garden to the relationship between two people.

**⛪ 神学意涵 Theological Significance**
• 安息日是恩典，不是律法的重担——人被造来享受神
• "用尘土造人"——人的卑微与尊贵并存
• "独居不好"——人是为团契和关系被造的
• 婚姻是神设立的圣约，不是社会契约

**✝️ 基督的影子 Shadow of Christ**
亚当沉睡，肋旁被开，夏娃从中而出；基督在十字架上"睡了"，肋旁被枪扎，血和水流出来（约19:34），教会从中诞生。保罗说婚姻的奥秘"是指着基督和教会说的"（弗5:32）。亚当与夏娃的合一，预表基督与教会的永恒联合。
Adam slept, his side was opened, and Eve came forth; Christ "slept" on the cross, his side was pierced, blood and water flowed out (John 19:34), and the Church was born. Paul says the mystery of marriage "refers to Christ and the church" (Eph 5:32). The union of Adam and Eve foreshadows the eternal union of Christ and his Church.
