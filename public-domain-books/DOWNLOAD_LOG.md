|------|--------|--------|-------|
| The Christian in Complete Armour | William Gurnall | ❌ Not Found | Archive.org links broken, may need specialized search |
| The Problem of Poverty | Abraham Kuyper | ❌ Not Found | Archive.org returns 503 errors, may not be digitized |

## Challenges Encountered

1. **CCEL.org Issues**: Returns HTML pages even when requesting epub/txt formats
2. **Limited Gutenberg Coverage**: Many Puritan/Reformed works not digitized
3. **Search Limitations**: Cannot search Gutenberg effectively without API
4. **Format Availability**: Many works available in HTML/text but not epub

## Recommendations for Remaining Books

1. **Use Alternative Sources**: 
   - HathiTrust Digital Library
   - Google Books (public domain)
   - Monergism.com (Reformed books)
   - Christian Classics Ethereal Library (convert HTML to epub)

2. **Manual Conversion**:
   - Download HTML/text versions from CCEL
   - Convert using Calibre or pandoc

3. **Specialized Archives**:
   - Post-Reformation Digital Library (PRDL)
   - Christian Heritage Digital Collection
   - Internet Archive (requires more specific searches)
