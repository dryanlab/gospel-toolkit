    "core_argument_en": "The ontological argument is an a priori argument that seeks to prove God's existence through logical analysis of the concept of the 'greatest conceivable being.' First formulated by Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), the argument proceeds: God is defined as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived.' If such a being exists only in understanding but not in reality, we could conceive of a greater being that exists both in understanding and reality. This would create a logical contradiction, therefore God must exist in reality. Modern philosopher Alvin Plantinga reformulated this argument using possible world semantics: if maximal greatness is instantiated in some possible world, then it is instantiated in every possible world, including the actual world. Kurt Gödel mathematically formalized the ontological argument, proving that in the S5 modal logic system, if God's existence is possible, then God necessarily exists. The argument's strength lies in its deductive nature: if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Critics like Gaunilo's 'perfect island' objection are answered by pointing out the distinction between necessary and contingent existence. Contemporary scholars like William Lane Craig argue that the argument at minimum establishes the rationality of theism and shifts the burden of proof to atheists.",

In possible world semantics, 'existing in all possible worlds' is a coherent concept.

Perfection for islands has inherent limitations (size, location, etc.), while divine perfection is unlimited. Plantinga points out that maximal greatness includes necessary existence, but the concept of a perfect island doesn't entail necessary existence. Anselm himself responded that only the concept of God has the unique property of requiring its own existence.

This is similar to mathematical proofs: we start with definitions (like 'prime number'), then prove certain properties. Plantinga's version explicitly distinguishes between possibility (maximal greatness is a coherent concept) and actuality (necessary existence derived therefrom). William Rowe admits that if the argument's modal intuitions are correct, it is indeed valid. The issue isn't circular reasoning, but whether we accept its modal premises.

Lewis in 'Miracles' pointed out that if naturalism is true, our beliefs are merely products of neurochemical processes rather than logical reasoning. This creates a self-defeating dilemma: if our cognitive abilities are results of purely physical causal chains, we have no reason to trust them to produce true beliefs, including naturalism itself. Alvin Plantinga further developed this argument into the 'Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism' (EAAN). He argues that under the joint hypothesis of evolution and naturalism, the probability of our cognitive faculties' reliability is low, because evolution only cares about survival fitness, not truth of beliefs. Victor Reppert detailed four versions of the argument from reason: the argument from reasoning, from mental unity, from intentionality, and from truth. Modern neuroscience research shows that while brain activity correlates with thinking, logical laws, mathematical truths, and moral principles cannot be reduced to physical processes. If rational thought requires non-material explanation, this points to a rational Creator.

The issue isn't whether evolution can produce useful cognitive abilities, but whether under naturalism, these abilities' reliability for truth-seeking is questionable.

Many beneficial false beliefs (like overconfidence, confirmation bias) might be more advantageous for survival than true beliefs. Paul Churchland admits that truth has no more adaptive advantage than error in evolutionary history. Moreover, even if low-level cognitive abilities (like perception) might be reliable, the reliability of higher-order abstract reasoning (mathematics, logic, metaphysics) is harder to explain under pure naturalism. Thomas Nagel in 'Mind and Cosmos' also acknowledges the seriousness of this problem."

The argument operates on multiple levels: First, the existence of objective beauty itself requires explanation. From the macrostructure of cosmic formations to the molecular geometry of DNA helixes, from the universal appearance of golden ratios in nature to the elegance of mathematical formulas, beauty seems embedded in the universe's foundational structure. Richard Dawkins admits, 'The universe has a kind of deep beauty that seems to suggest design.' Second, human aesthetic sensitivity is evolutionarily superfluous. Aesthetic experiences—deep emotional responses to sunsets, music, art—have no obvious adaptive value for survival and reproduction, yet constitute some of humanity's most profound experiences. Einstein observed, 'The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible, and beautiful.' Third, beauty possesses cross-cultural universality. Despite vast cultural differences, all human societies exhibit pursuit and recognition of beauty. Fourth, beauty's deep connection with truth suggests metaphysical unity. The most beautiful mathematical theories are often the most true (like quantum mechanics and relativity). Paul Dirac famously stated, 'It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.'

More importantly, beauty in mathematics and physics has clear objective standards: simplicity, symmetry, elegance. These aren't cultural constructions but reflect deep structural principles. If beauty were completely subjective, why do the most beautiful mathematical theories often best describe reality? Why can physicists discover new natural laws through aesthetic intuition? Max Planck said, 'New scientific truth triumphs not by convincing opponents, but by attracting the younger generation through its inherent beauty.'

Furthermore, if aesthetic preferences were merely evolutionary products, why can humans transcend these preferences? We can appreciate initially frightening modern art, find beauty in abstract mathematics. Steven Pinker calls art an 'evolutionary byproduct,' but this cannot explain why this 'byproduct' is so universal, persistent, and closely connected to truth.

    "core_argument_zh": "宗教经验论证基于这样的洞察：如果上帝存在，我们期待人们会有直接体验上帝的可能性，而全球范围内报告的宗教经验现象正好符合这一期待。理查德·斯温伯恩（Richard Swinburne）是现代该论证的主要倡导者，他基于「看似原则」（principle of credulity）论证：除非有强有力的反证，我们应该相信事物如其所显现的那样。如果有人报告体验到上帝的同在，我们有初步理由相信这种经验是真实的。宗教经验具有几个显著特征：普遍性（跨越所有文化和历史时期）、一致性（尽管描述不同，核心特征相似）、转化性（通常导致深刻的生命改变）、以及认知内容（不仅是情感，还包含关于实在本质的洞察）。威廉·詹姆斯（William James）在《宗教经验种种》中详细分析了神秘体验的特征：不可言喻性、认识特质、短暂性和被动性。现代研究显示，宗教经验在神经学上是真实的，涉及特定的脑区活动，但这并不证明其是幻觉，正如感官知觉涉及大脑活动但仍能传达关于外在世界的信息。卡罗琳·弗兰克斯·戴维斯（Caroline Franks Davis）论证，宗教经验作为证据具有累积效应：单个经验可能有疑问，但大量相似经验的汇聚构成了强有力的证据基础。",
    "core_argument_en": "The argument from religious experience is based on the insight that if God exists, we would expect the possibility of people directly experiencing God, and globally reported religious experiences precisely match this expectation. Richard Swinburne is the modern argument's primary advocate, arguing from the 'principle of credulity': unless there are strong counter-evidences, we should believe things are as they appear. If someone reports experiencing God's presence, we have prima facie reason to believe this experience is genuine. Religious experiences have several notable characteristics: universality (across all cultures and historical periods), consistency (despite different descriptions, core features are similar), transformative power (usually leading to profound life changes), and cognitive content (not merely emotional, but containing insights about reality's nature). William James in 'The Varieties of Religious Experience' analyzed mystical experience characteristics: ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity. Modern research shows religious experiences are neurologically real, involving specific brain region activity, but this doesn't prove they're hallucinations, just as sensory perception involves brain activity yet conveys information about the external world. Caroline Franks Davis argues that religious experiences as evidence have cumulative effect: individual experiences might be questionable, but the convergence of numerous similar experiences constitutes a powerful evidential foundation.",

        "response_en": "This objection commits the 'genetic fallacy'—attempting to negate truth by explaining the phenomenon's causation. Discovering neural correlates of religious experience no more proves the experience false than discovering visual perception's neural correlates proves vision false. Michael Persinger's 'God helmet' experiments indeed induced religion-like experiences, but this only proves the brain has capacity for transcendent experiences, not that all religious experiences are artificially manufactured. Andrew Newberg's neuroimaging studies show deep meditation and prayer alter brain activity, but experiencers still report these as their most real and important life experiences. Furthermore, many religious experiences occur without expectation or inducement, often conflicting with experiencers' prior beliefs. More importantly, if God wanted to communicate with humans, he must work through human cognitive mechanisms, so discovering neural foundations is completely predictable. Richard Dawkins admits: 'Even if we could completely explain religious experience's neural mechanisms, this wouldn't prove God doesn't exist.' The key question isn't whether experiences have physical foundations, but whether these experiences accurately convey information about transcendent reality."

        "response_en": "This objection exaggerates differences between religious experiences while ignoring their core commonalities. Scholars like Evelyn Underhill and Aldous Huxley discovered that cross-religious mystical experiences share remarkable common features: direct contact with ultimate reality, dissolution of self-boundaries, experience of unconditional love, and profound peace and joy. Differences mainly appear at the interpretive level, not in experience itself. A Christian might interpret the experience as encountering Jesus, while a Buddhist might interpret it as enlightenment, but underlying phenomenological characteristics (ineffable sense of unity, transcendent space-time perception) are similar. This is like people from different cultures viewing the same mountain—they'll describe it using different languages and conceptual frameworks, but this doesn't mean the mountain doesn't exist. Moreover, even if some contradictions exist, this cannot entirely negate religious experience's cognitive value. Scientific observations also contain contradictions and errors, but we don't abandon sensory perception. John Hick's 'religious pluralism' suggests different religious experiences might reflect different aspects of the same sacred reality. Most importantly, even if only some religious experiences are genuine, this suffices to support theism."

        "response_en": "This criticism is based on overly narrow epistemological assumptions. Many valid knowledge sources cannot be objectively verified through empirical scientific methods: mathematical truths, logical principles, aesthetic judgments, moral intuitions, even other minds' existence. If we insisted only objectively verifiable experiences are valid, we would lose most of human cognition's content. Furthermore, religious experiences do have certain verifiable aspects: their transformative effects, ethical consequences, cross-cultural consistency can all be studied and measured. Many studies show religious experiences correlate with positive mental health, altruistic behavior, life satisfaction. More importantly, religious experiences' nature determines they cannot completely conform to scientific verification standards. If God is a personal being, his choice of whom and when to reveal himself is his sovereignty. This isn't like studying gravity or electromagnetic force where experiments can be repeated. William Alston argues religious experiences can be viewed as a kind of 'perceptual practice' with its own verification standards, just as sensory perception has its own reliability checks. Finally, requiring religious experiences to meet scientific standards might be a category error, equivalent to demanding poetry conform to mathematical formula standards."

    "core_argument_en": "The contingency argument, also called the cosmological argument from contingency, originated with philosopher Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), proving the existence of a necessary being (God) through analyzing the relationship between existence and contingency. The argument's core insight is: everything in the universe is contingent (could exist or not exist), but a collection of contingent beings cannot explain its own existence. Even if this collection is infinite, it remains contingent and needs external explanation. Leibniz formulated the principle of sufficient reason: every fact must have sufficient reason explaining why it is thus and not otherwise. Modern versions developed by philosophers like Richard Taylor and Alexander Pruss: (1) Every observed thing in the universe is contingent; (2) Any collection of contingent things (including infinite collections) is itself contingent; (3) Contingent things require explanation external to themselves; (4) Therefore there must exist a non-contingent, necessary being to explain contingent things' existence; (5) This necessary being is God. Contemporary cosmological discoveries strengthen this argument: the universe's finite age, Big Bang singularity, fine-tuning of physical constants all demonstrate the universe's contingency. Even under multiverse hypotheses, each possible universe remains contingent, and the entire multiverse collection needs explanation. Quantum mechanics' randomness further confirms the contingent nature of fundamental physical events.",

        "response_en": "Criticism of the principle of sufficient reason mainly stems from misunderstanding its nature. First, quantum mechanics' randomness doesn't violate PSR, because quantum events still follow probabilistic laws, and these laws themselves need explanation. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle describes limits of our cognition, not absence of causal relations. Second, PSR has different formulations. Alexander Pruss distinguishes 'strong version' (requiring every fact has causal explanation) from 'weak version' (requiring existence facts have explanation). The contingency argument only needs the weak version. Third, denying PSR leads to profound skepticism. If things could exist without reason, we couldn't conduct any scientific research or rational inference. Even skeptics like David Hume practically relied on causal reasoning. Fourth, PSR is universally applied and confirmed in mathematics, logic, and science. Denying it requires bearing enormous philosophical costs. Finally, even if we accept some brute facts, the contingency argument can still be modified as probabilistic argument: the necessary being hypothesis better explains observed universe characteristics than pure contingency hypothesis."

The argument isn't about causal chains in temporal sequence (which might be infinite), but about dependence relations of existence. Even if there are infinitely many contingent beings, this entire infinite series is itself contingent and needs explanation for why it exists rather than not. This is like infinitely many train cars: even with infinitely many cars, if each lacks its own power, the entire train still needs external locomotive to pull it. William Rowe's example is compelling: even with infinitely many dependent beings (like infinite generations, each depending on the previous), why this entire sequence exists remains a question. The circular causation proposal faces more serious difficulties: if A depends on B, B depends on C, and C depends on A, then each member depends on other members with none having independent existential foundation. This violates basic metaphysical principles. Moreover, even allowing temporal circularity (highly dubious physically), existential circularity remains impossible because it requires an object to depend on itself for existence, which is logically contradictory."

A necessary being cannot have beginning or end, nor variable properties. Second, the universe's constituent elements (matter, energy, spacetime) are obviously contingent. Hydrogen atoms might or might not exist, gravitational constant could have different values, spacetime could have different dimensions. If components are contingent, how can the whole be necessary? Third, if the universe were necessarily existing, it must exist in all possible worlds with identical properties. But this contradicts physics' discoveries showing the universe's properties are variable. Fourth, necessary existence concepts usually include perfection (because any defect implies possibility of improvement, thus contingency). But the universe contains obvious imperfections and evil. Finally, even if some 'universe' were necessary, this couldn't determine it's the specific universe we observe, but might be a more fundamental reality with different properties—which actually supports theism."

In atheistic materialism, only concrete, particular, changing, and non-authoritative material phenomena exist, which cannot account for these characteristics of logical laws. Second, preconditions of morality: objective moral standards require absoluteness, universality, and authority. Without an eternal, unchanging moral lawgiver, morality becomes mere subjective opinion or social convention, losing its binding force. Third, preconditions of science: science presupposes the uniformity of nature—that the future will operate according to the same natural laws as the past.

But presuppositionalism uses transcendental argument, whose structure proves that a certain proposition is the necessary precondition for all other knowledge and reasoning.
